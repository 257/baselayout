* rc-scripts 1.1.8 (15 Nov 2001)

  16 Nov 2001; removed bogus "mountall.test" script.
  
  15 Nov 2001; Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org): Updated
  init.d/{runscript.sh,depscan.sh}, sbin/rc to the new dep being 'use' not
  'uses', as it fits better with 'need' (not 'needs').  Also removed unneeded
  for loop from init.d/depscan.sh, and other fixes.  Updated names of new
  functions in init.d/runscript.sh to better sounding ones.  Updated
  init.d/modules, init.d/netmount to use 'use'.  Lots of other fixes/cleanups.
  Removed try() out of init.d/runscript.sh (why was this here ?).

  14 Nov 2001; Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org): init.d/bootmisc:  Now
  cleans /tmp.  Also creates /etc/resolv.conf if it doesn't exist.

  init.d/hostname:  Added check for a valid /etc/hostname.

  init.d/keymaps:  Added check for valid $KEYMAP.

  init.d/modules:  Added sysklogd, metalog, syslog-ng as 'use' deps.  This
  should solve Woodchip's syslog+glue issue.  We just have to change the
  console loglevel for metalog and syslog-ng (sysklogd already updated) not to
  output info and warnings, etc to the console, then boot will be much cleaner.
  Also the install guide will need changing to add the loggers to 'boot' and
  not 'default' runlevel.

  init.d/mountall.test:  Hopefully updated to the new rc-scripts style.  Is
  this really needed (I cannot see that it is used anywhere ...)?

  13 Nov 2001; Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org): Updated
  init.d/runscript.sh, init.d/depscan.sh and sbin/rc with a new depend called
  'uses'.  It basically have the same usage as 'need', except that it do not
  start services that is not in the current and 'boot' runlevels.

  Updated init.d/netmount to use the 'uses' depend.

  11 Nov 2001; Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org): Fixed init.d/runscript.sh
  not to destroy the 'need' depends in /${svcdir}/need.  This caused subsequent
  starting and stopping of services not to start depends.

  7 Nov 2001; Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org): Fixed a problem in sbin/rc
  where the ${svcdir}/softscripts directory got destroyed before stopping
  running services scheduled to be stopped.  This with the fact that $SOFTLEVEL
  was set too early, caused the services to be stopped in the wrong order.

  30 Oct 2001; Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org): Modified init.d/netmount to
  check if any network filesystems is mounted.

  29 Oct 2001; init.d/netmount: umount -art doesn't seem to work, so I added
  some awk and grep magic to find all remote filesystems and umount them.
  
  29 Oct 2001; Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org): A fix for checkroot
  (missing "/"); it now actually checks the root filesystem.  Also, a
  localmount cleanliness fix.
