rc-scripts-1.1.6, released 15 Sep 2001
======================================

	*init.d/runscript.sh, others
	Handling of "net" dependencies resolve to all net devices in
	/etc/runlevels/boot and /etc/runlevels/[curr-runlevel].  INTERFACES
	variable in /etc/rc.conf has been removed.
	
	*init.d/runscript.sh
	New "zap" option for manually resetting the state of an initscript
	to stopped.

	*init.d/{samba,sysklogd,sshd}
	Removed from CVS; they live in their respective packages.

rc-scripts-1.1.5, released 02 Sep 2001
====================================

	*sbin/rc-update
	New version of the rc-update command for the new initscripts.  Works
	similarly to the old version, except this one updates our dependency
	cache.

	*init.d/functions.sh
	New and better looking informational message functions (einfo, einfon).
	Brand new message functions (ewarn).

	*sbin/init, init.d/checkroot
	We're going back to a /proc/mounts-based mtab symlink because it's 
	just plain better.  Appropriate changes made.
