  29 Oct 2001; init.d/netmount: umount -art doesn't seem to work, so 
  I added some awk and grep magic to find all remote filesystems and 
  umount them.
  
  29 Oct 2001; Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org)
  A fix for checkroot (missing "/"); it now actually checks the root
  filesystem.  Also, a localmount cleanliness fix.

* rc-scripts 1.1.7 (18 Oct 2001)

[old changelog format follows]

	*lots of scripts; woodchip
	removed old rc5 scripts from cvs

	*init.d/runscript.sh; agriffis
	Added support for rc.conf and home-grown functions
	
	*init.d/modules;
	Now correctly looks at /etc/modules.autoload

rc-scripts-1.1.6, released 15 Sep 2001
======================================

	*init.d/runscript.sh, others
	Handling of "net" dependencies resolve to all net devices in
	/etc/runlevels/boot and /etc/runlevels/[curr-runlevel].  INTERFACES
	variable in /etc/rc.conf has been removed.
	
	*init.d/runscript.sh
	New "zap" option for manually resetting the state of an initscript
	to stopped.

	*init.d/{samba,sysklogd,sshd}
	Removed from CVS; they live in their respective packages.

rc-scripts-1.1.5, released 02 Sep 2001
====================================

	*sbin/rc-update
	New version of the rc-update command for the new initscripts.  Works
	similarly to the old version, except this one updates our dependency
	cache.

	*init.d/functions.sh
	New and better looking informational message functions (einfo, einfon).
	Brand new message functions (ewarn).

	*sbin/init, init.d/checkroot
	We're going back to a /proc/mounts-based mtab symlink because it's 
	just plain better.  Appropriate changes made.
