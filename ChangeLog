  17 Jan 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    net.lo changed logic to read "only fail if no configuration parameters
    work, bring interface down and abort". Fixes #78092

  13 Jan 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    wpa_supplicant forces ctrl_interface to /var/run/wpa_supplicant
    and removes stale directories
    clean_pidfile function no longer errors on empty pidfiles
    net dependancies corrected in runscript.sh - fixes #77839
    allow pure IPv6 addresses - fixes #73844

  12 Jan 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    net.lo now ignores dot files when loading modules
    ipppd module now stops correctly - fixes #73067 again

  11 Jan 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    added "noop" config parameter which means take no action if the interface
    is up and has an address configured, otherwise continue
    addresses are now removed when starting an interface - fixes #77111

  06 Jan 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    ifconfig, udhcpc-ifconfig now deletes addresses using 0.0.0.0 for uclibc
    - fixes #76846

  05 Jan 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    dhcpcd and udhcpc now run via the eval statement so quotes can be used
    in options. Fixes #74053 - thanks to Evan Buswell
    (merged from HEAD change on 12 Dec 2004)

  04 Jan 2005; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    bridge now marks interfaces as UP - fixes #75354
    iwconfig now sets enc keys through an eval statement - fixes #76601
    updated wireless.example for whitespace in keys
    iwconfig now accepts mode "auto" and defaults to it

  19 Dec 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    iwconfig now sets ESSIDVAR for master/ad-hoc modes - fixes #74802

  18 Dec 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    macchanger now localalises ${opts} - fixes #74809

  17 Dec 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    wpa_supplicant now brings the interface up before launching - fixes #74637

  16 Dec 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    wpa_supplicant - fixed file location for wpa_cli and association test
    as it they changed in wpa_supplicant-0.3.x

  12 Dec 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

  09 Dec 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    fixed net.lo getting vlan config
    rc doesn't stop hotplugged devices when system is booting - fixes #61594
    thanks to Andreas Sundebo for the fix

  07 Dec 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    essidnet - fixed setting up search domains
    removed hardcoded ath0 in wpa_supplicant
    ifconfig now reads the old gateway variable correctly - fixes #73641

  06 Dec 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    macchanger defaults to setting the interface down, and then trying
    with it up - fixes #71929
    macchanger converts mac_${IFACE} to lowercase - fixes #73549
    iproute2 now configures the interface up everytime we add an address
    removed "need interface" from all modules depends as net.lo requires
    interface anyway

  05 Dec 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    dhclient now kill it's process if it failed to get a lease on startup
    all dhclient responses are now handled correctly

  04 Dec 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    place and changed hardcoded eth1 to ${interface} in udhcpc-ifconfig.
    Fixes #73327 - thanks to Benoit Boissinot

    essidnet gets the essid itself instead of relying on ${ESSID}
    wpa_supplicant module added
    config-system now creates files as .tmp instead of .new and loads
    the wpa_supplicant module if needed
    ifconfig now addes aliases to devices other than eth0
    dhcpcd, dhclient, pump and udhcpc now expose the dhcp_${IFACE} variable
    instead of the old peer_dns_${IFACE}, peer_ntp_${IFACE}, peer_nis_${IFACE}
    ones

    removed modules use dependancy in net.lo and added installed
    - this allows use to provide "virtual" modules which are only "installed"
      when other depended modules are installed

* rc-scripts 1.6.7 (03 Dec 2004)

  03 Dec 2004; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>:

    Simply filesystem unmounting in halt.sh.  Based upon work by Georg Sauthoff 
    #68697.  Also clean up the filesystem remounting readonly.  As a last 
    resort to filesystems which won't remount readonly, we try to unmount them 
    with the force/readonly options.  Idea from #70349.

  03 Dec 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    Fixed config-system for only changing hostname when needed
    udhcpc and dhclient now restore saved configs when stopping and work
    with non-infinite leases
    Moved generic dhcp options into a space seperated string
    udhcpc now caches it's IP address and requests it the next time it starts
    if the address is not released
    udhcpc and dhclient no longer flush interfaces if we don't need too
    ipppd module now looks for ipppd in /usr/sbin - fixes #73067

  02 Dec 2004; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>:

    Merge time checking function (is_older_than) to help simplify config 
    file update checking.  Used for now in env-update.sh #71285.  Function 
    written by Paul Pacheco #55329.

  02 Dec 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    Added option dhcp_release to specify if we release the DHCP lease or not
    defaults to no
    Changed variables peer_* to dhcp_*
    dhclient and udhcpc now specify a pidfile
    Fixed iwconfig report if iwgetid does not support --channel

  01 Dec 2004; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>:

    Refix and clean up the netmount script to kill processes #64034.

  01 Dec 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    Documentation fixes regarding iwconfig and linux-wlan-ng
    Fixed bonding deps per bug #71419

  30 Nov 2004; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>:

    Fix the UML/coLinux check in init.d/clock #72937.

    Allow the user to override the default mount options via /etc/fstab 
    for all the mounts.  Added a 'is_in_fstab' function to see if the 
    user has defined the mount, and if not, fall back to the hardcoded 
    stuff from before.  This also lets us get rid of $RC_DEVICE_FS #70044.

  26 Nov 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    Fixed up address detection in apipa
    net.lo now checks for duplicate static IPv4 addresses before assigning
    iwconfig now supports preassociate and postassociate user hooks
    net.example - changed $1 to ${IFACE} in examples
    clarified lack of linux-wlan-ng support

  24 Nov 2004; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>:

    Allow users to specify charset option to dumpkeys when using unicode 
    in conf.d/keymaps #72225.  Also move all the init.d/keymap specific 
    options out of rc.conf and into conf.d/keymaps and add some config 
    checks to init.d/keymaps like the clock/hostname init.d scripts.

    Make sure /etc/rc.conf overrides conf.d files when starting up 
    critical services.  Should help out with transition from rc.conf.

  24 Nov 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    Ensure all net-scripts modules depend on interface_variable function
    where applicable
    Fixed adsl stopping - #68934. Thanks to Andreas Kauer

  23 Nov 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    iproute2 does not need to create dummy interfaces for aliases
    unlike ifconfig so we no longer do this
    We now bring down all aliases and addresses properly
    Split off some functions from net.lo into helpers.d/functions
    so that our DHCP helper scripts can use them too :)
    Deprecated interface specific setup in favour of a generic config
    macchanger brings interface up now - fixes #71929
    DHCP over VLAN now works - fixes #71860
    Disabled modified function checking as it's far too expensive on CPU
    and still isn't 100% reliable
    When specifing a module that isn't emerged, you now get an error
    telling you what to emerge
    Removed -p option from the diff call used for function removal
    Removed rp_filter setting - fixes first part of bug #71971
    Added sysctl.conf settings relating to rp_filter to sysctl.conf
    - fixes last part of bug #71971
    Fixed pump exporing ntp servers
    implemented MODULES_DIR so we can change directory we load from on the fly
    fixed variables for vlans in most modules
    
  19 Nov 2004; Aron Grffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Remove crap "ll" and "d" aliases from skel .bashrc

  19 Nov 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    tests for hostname (none) when sending hostname via dhcpcd, udhpc or pump
    udhcpc now does correct signal handling so we can release leases and
    terminate cleanly
    Improved pump process detection
    Rewrote udhcpc helper scripts around udhcpc and wrapped dhclient to udhcpc
    scripts. This makes things much saner as udhcpc is much saner - also fixed
    essidnet and ipv6 local link for them.
    removed iproute2 udhcpc reliance on the "bc" command

  17 Nov 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    Fixed invalid variable handling in bonding and vlan - bug #71419
    apipa now brings the interface up before testing if address exists
    Updated bonding documentation - bug #71419
    Fixed iproute2 adding addresses for vlans - bug #71419
    ifconfig handle inet6 routing automatically - bug #33310
    ifconfig - fixed old gateway + gateway in routes conflict
    iproute2 cleaned up some functions

  16 Nov 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    We no longer default a fallback to APIPA when no config is given
    net.example fleshed out a bit more for dhcpcd - fixes #60845
    Improved forced module handling a touch
    modules_sort and modules_check_user in net.lo buffer _provides,
      _before and _after in arrays to avoid shelling out

  15 Nov 2004; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>:

    Add a check to clock init.d to make sure users dont try to set 
    config their clock in rc.conf anymore.

    Redo hostname/domainname scripts to use files in /etc/conf.d/ 
    instead of creating files in /etc/.  Allows for controlling things 
    like the behavior of setting the 'domain' in resolv.conf since users 
    may not always understand exactly what's going on.

    Stop referring to conf.d/basic as a global rc config option.  That 
    file hasn't been used in a long time and has since been replaced 
    with env.d/00basic.  Updated sbin/runscript.sh, etc/profile, 
    sbin/rc-help.sh, and src/awk/cachedepends.awk.

    Run `find | xargs` instead of `find -exec`.  Much better performance 
    this way, and busybox friendly #59732.

  15 Nov 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    Split modules_load into smaller more managable functions in net.lo
    Added modules_force option to net.lo with a big phat warning in
      net.example about it potentially breaking networking
    Added searchdomains_ESSID option to essidnet
    Stopped the domain setting from putting the same entry in search
      in config-system and essidnet
    Removed second warning in net.lo when configuration not set
    Documented APIPA module in net.example
    Added kernel checking for vlan - fixes #70829
    Added kernel checking for bonding, bridging and tuntap
    Added iproute2 support to the APIPA module

  13 Nov 2004; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>:

    Update the svcdir mounting #69595.  Instead of mounting in /mnt 
    and then bind mounting to $svcdir, we mount the ramdisk on $svcidr.

  12 Nov 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    Added arping duplicate address detection to net.lo
    Created Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) module

    Added dependancy checking to ipppd
    Bonding is now started pre instead of post
    Fixed iface variable in dhcp modules for vlans
    Changed get_device to interface_device
    Changed get_type to interface_type
    Added vlan configuration options and documented them in net.example
    Fixed bridge configuration handling
    Removed _get_vlans from iproute2 and ifconfig as vlan now does it itself

  11 Nov 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    Fixed category of rp-pppoe to net-dialup error when requesting ADSL
    Improved inet6 address deletion and detection in iproute2
    Improved gateway logic in ifconfig
    Changed all wireless reporting functions to use iwgetid instead of
      parsing iwconfig output except for essid

* rc-scripts 1.6.6 (08 Nov 2004)

  08 Nov 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    Added options to configure bridge
    Added bridge configuration example to net.example
    Added missing required function interface_exists to iptunnel check_depends

  07 Nov 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Fix shell scripting errors that would result in 
    /sbin/functions.sh: line 166: [: too many arguments.

  05 Nov 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    net-scripts/net.modules.d/bridge
    - fixed destroying a bridge if no ports were added
    - starts interfaces if they don't exist - fixed bug #65153

    net-scrips/net.modules.d/bonding
    - starts interfaces if they don't exist

    net-scripts/init.d/net.lo
    - added net_start() function to start depandant ifaces
      so that bridge br0 can active tun0 which net.tun0 has to create
    - added use dependany on wlan incase we're using linux-wlan-ng drivers
      fixes bug #64978
    - moved start() to run_start() and stop() to run_stop()
      created run() and new start()/stop() functions
      this is so that we have one single entry point to localise variables
      and to remove any added functions loaded by our modules
    - removed redundant interface_exists() as it's provided by
      ifconfig and/or iproute2

    net-scripts/net.modules.d/ifconfig and iproute2
    - added ifconfig_tunnel and iproute2_tunnel functions

    addred gre/ipip tunnel support via the the tunnel module
    - fixes bug #50765

  04 Nov 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    net-scripts/net.modules.d/pump
    - fixed setting ntp servers

    net-scripts/net.modules.d/dhcpcd
    - fixed stopping function

    net-scripts/net.modules.d/bonding
    - fixed module to actually work with the interface

    net-scripts/init.d/net.lo
    - we remove all added functions when restarting an interface
      this relies on the diff command being available

    added isdn support via the new ipppd module - fixes bug #69035

    net-scripts/conf.d/net.example
    - added sample isdn setup

    net-scripts/conf.d/wireless.example
    - added better descriptions to the _sleep variables

    Fixed boolean logic error when testing is_net_up in /sbin/runscript.sh
    - fixed bug #70022

    net.lo - added get_type function to return the type of the interface
    - eth, ippp, etc

    ipppd, tuntap
    - start() moved to pre_start() and we now test by type
      this means you no longer need ifconfig_ippp0=( "isdn" "dhcp" )
      as ippp0 is always an isdn device

    bridge - fixed stop function and moved start() to pre_start()
      and automatically start if the variable bridge_${iface} exists

    net.example - fixed up documentation for changed behaviour above

  03 Nov 2004; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>:

    When launching critical services in /sbin/rc, make sure we source 
    the conf.d file (if it exists).  Resolves #69956.

  03 Nov 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    net-scripts/init.d/net.lo
    - fixed !module when it's not installed
    - we can now specify null inet addresses in the config
      this allows a pure inet6 setup
    - shutdown lo the same way we bring it up

    net-scripts/net.modules.d/ifconfig
    - changed IPv6 to inet6 in output of adding inet6 addresses
    - just output inet6 address removed, not eth0 del foo

    net-scripts/net.modules.d/iproute2
    - fix deletion of non-link addresses - fixes bug #65417 (again)
    - handle inet6 addresses like ifconfig - fixes more bug #65417

    net-scripts/conf.d/net.example
    - noted that inet6 addresses do not create aliases
    - added examples of assigning inet6 addresses

    net-scripts/net.modules.d/iwconfig
    - improve error message when card does not support scanning

    net-scripts/conf.d/wireless.example
    - fixed comment regarding preferred_aps not working with cards that don't
      support scanning

  02 Nov 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    net-scripts/conf.d/net.example
    - added bridging and tuntap examples

    net-scripts/init.d/net.lo
    - modprobe ${IFACE} when ${IFACE} does not exist

    net-scripts/net.modules.d/ifconfig
    - fixed interface existance check

    net-scripts/net.modules.d
    ifconfig & iproute2
    - added boolean to interface_exists to report if it exists or not
    - added checks to see if the interface exists or not when starting

    dhcpcd
    - removed debug line

    bonding, dhclient, dhcpcd, essidnet, macchanger, pump, udhcpc
    - added checks to see if the interface exists or not when starting

    tuntap
    - added checks to see if the interface exists or not when stopping

  01 Nov 2004; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>:

    Dump the error message that hwclock returns since it tends to be 
    quite useful.  Modified init.d/clock.

    Fix error in functions.sh [ -z "$@" ] -> [[ -z "$@" ]] #69789.

    Don't create /dev/sndstat link anymore in populate_udev per #69635.

  01 Nov 2004; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    net-scripts/init.d/net.lo:
    - modules specified by interface config now error if they are not loaded
    - moved interface check to after preup incase user preup loads drivers
    - modules can be explicitly not used by prefixing them with a !
      however, they are still available to other modules
      fixes bugs #68908, #69027
    - remove check to see if interface exists
    - modules may setup new interfaces and still require config
      so we have a new label counter in iface_start
    - removed the check to see if a class wrapping already exists
      this fixes the bug where ifconfig and iproute2 are installed, but
      ifconfig is asked for and the interface is restarted.
    - added check to see if the configured module is loaded
      and installed or not in iface_start
    - add dependancy on isdn4linux - fixes bug #69035
    - interface_exists moved to iproute and ifconfig

    net-scripts/net.modules.d
    - Split wireless module into iwconfig and essidnet modules
    - Added tuntap and bridge modules, fixes bug #55394, #30688

    net-scripts/init.d/iwconfig:
    - wep mode is now reported
    - removed post_stop function so we keep existing config
    - added pre_stop to set the ESSID variable
    - changed to veinfo/vewarn where appropriate
    - check if interface exists otherwise abort gracefully
    - no longer deletes addresses as we now avoid
      ipv6 local addresses in detecting if interface has an addresses or not

    net-scripts/init.d/ifconfig:
    - added flag enable/disable function
    - scope:link inet6 addresses are ignored when testing is_up and
      del_addresses - fixes bug #65417

    net-scripts/init.d/iproute2:
    - added flag enable/disable function
    - scope:link inet6 addresses are ignored when testing is_up and
      del_addresses - fixes bug #65417

    net-scripts/init.d/macchanger:
    - fixed detecting whether the change worked or not, fixes bug #68893

    net-scripts/init.d/vlan:
    - fixed old config problem

  31 Oct 2004; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Do not delete depscan and envupdate caches on reboot, as this should
    improve bootup times - works nicely with the '-u' parameters of both.
    Also move the '-u' parameter test of depscan.sh after the directory
    exist test, else ${svcdir}/started/, etc do not exist.  Modified both
    /sbin/rc and /sbin/depscan.sh for this.

    Move things around in /sbin/functions.sh to have all functions above.

    Add the 'lo' option to RC_NET_STRICT_CHECKING to resolve bug #29225.

  28 Oct 2004; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Only add files not managed by udev to device tarball, bug #57110.

  28 Oct 2004; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>:

    Revert pam_console_apply udev check in bootmisc/halt.sh since 
    the bug is with pam_console_apply and not udev/pam.

    Use ${EUID} instead of $(id -u) to help out BSD in runscript.sh.

    Allow users to select ramfs instead of default tmpfs for mounting 
    on /dev with udev #69091.

    Add issue.devfix which would be auto copied to /etc/issue if 
    /sbin/rc detects the user is missing /dev/null or /dev/console.  
    Includes a simple explanation/fix for what's wrong.

    Make sure the clock init script runs after checkroot/modules/localmount 
    so that timestamps are synchronized asap #68133 / #70008.

    Accept '-nc' as a short option to '--nocolor' #64736.

  26 Oct 2004; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>:

    Don't use -A with fsck to respect the fs_passno since it'll try 
    to fsck all filesystems, not just the ones specified.  Instead, 
    awk /etc/fstab to review the passno field in checkroot #68822.

    Add support for 'gentoo=forcefsck' boot option in checkroot.

    Make sure we run devfsd in /sbin/rc even when /dev has been 
    automounted by the kernel #68795.

    Don't generate the device tarball in halt.sh with livecds #68469.

  25 Oct 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    net-scripts/net.modules.d/ifconfig:
    - Simplify ifconfig_is_up() 
    - Fix ifconfig_get_aliases_rev() to actually work... you can't
      specify an interface name to ifconfig if you want to see the
      aliases.
    - Workaround a couple ifconfig bugs dealing with aliases
    - Correct a return status in ifconfig_interface_del_addresses()
    - ifconfig_iface_stop() is bool, not void; fix the comments

    net-scripts/net.modules.d/iproute2:
    - iproute2_iface_stop() is bool, not void.  Fix the code so it
      returns meaningful values

    net-scripts/init.d/net.lo:
    - Fix preferred (ifconfig/dhcpcd) module loading so it doesn't
      barf when a preferred module is either (1) missing from
      net.modules.d or (2) not available due to missing dependencies
    - When loading all modules in order to stop an interface, only use
      the first available to satisfy each class wrapper

  24 Oct 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Include livecd patch that was applied to baselayout-1.9.4-r6
    to use agetty instead of mingetty

  24 Oct 2004; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>:

    Mount tmpfs instead of ramfs on /dev when using udev systems.
    The problem with ramfs is that it has no size limitations so 
    one could easily take down their machine by accident #68653.

* rc-scripts 1.6.3 (23 Oct 2004)

  22 Oct 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Add support for user_eth0 in the adsl module and in net.example.
    This means that most users won't need to edit pppoe.conf at all

  21 Oct 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Remove old etc/conf.d/net and try to clarify instructions in
    net-scripts/conf.d/net.example.  Add example for ADSL

  21 Oct 2004; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>:

    Merge all of the UML checks into one function, is_uml_sys(), 
    which is now in functions.sh.

  18 Oct 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Add v-e-commands (veinfo, vbegin, etc) to sbin/functions.sh that
    depend on RC_VERBOSE which defaults to no.  Add --verbose to args
    understood by runscript.sh.

    In net.lo, use veinfo and friends when loading modules since this
    information is confusing to users.

    In net.lo, always load global "modules" setting in following
    "modules_iface" since this is a little easier for users to
    understand.

    In net.lo, use eindent for output of pre/post scripts

  18 Oct 2004; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>:

    Add shfs to our list of net filesystems #61452.  Also add afs/nfs4.

    Add a '-u' parameter to depscan.sh to allow for updates only when 
    the config files have changed.  With /sbin/rc using this, we speed 
    up bootup by only regenerating the cache when need be #67976.  Also 
    add a '-u' parameter to env-update.sh for same reasons.

    Don't run depscan.sh in rc-update anymore since the cache files don't 
    depend on runlevels (which is all that rc-update modifies).

    Add unicode support to keymaps/consolefont #32111 and UML support #29707.

    Add checks to many filesystem operations in the eventuality that the 
    filesystems are mounted read only.

  16 Oct 2004; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>:

    Update the default fstab /dev/shm mount to include the nodev, nosuid, 
    and noexec mount flags.  No reason for the filesystem to have those.

    Cleaned up the clock init script.  Moved the clock options out of 
    rc.conf and into its own conf.d/clock file.  Added support for the 
    weird Alpha consoles SRM/ARC since they need special config options.  
    Also made the syncing of system clock to hardware clock at shutdown 
    optional (with the default being off) #15834.  Don't try to set the 
    clock if running inside a coLinux environment #52870.

    Update default PATH ordering to try to follow default behavior in 
    other distro's and because it's logical that /usr/local should 
    override /usr which should override /.  Fixes #12531.

    Move devfs stuff out of baselayout and into the devfsd package.

    Don't run /sbin/pam_console_apply -r if using udev on /dev #50315.

  14 Oct 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Fix rc-status to work with new COLS code.

  14 Oct 2004; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>:

    Allow users to mount ramfs/tmpfs/ramdisk as their svcdir and 
    stop assuming ramfs==ramdisk #64079.

  13 Oct 2004; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>:

    Rework the code for managing /dev to make it more flexible for 
    users.  Some don't want to use devfs/udev but rather just create 
    their own nodes.  Handles some issues with #44906 / #67276.

    Move the utmp clearing code out of bootmisc and into /sbin/rc.  
    The utmp log must be cleared while in the initial boot level 
    (meaning inside /sbin/rc) because as soon as rc exists, init 
    writes a 'boot' record (`who -b`) which would normally be lost 
    when the bootmisc init.d script is run #61727.

  13 Oct 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Cosmetic fixes for starting loopback interface

    SpanKY doesn't like the dots... disable them by default, but you
    can set RC_DOT_PATTERN=' .' in /etc/conf.d/rc to get them back

* rc-scripts 1.6.2 (13 Oct 2004)

  13 Oct 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Install net.modules.d to /lib/rcscripts instead of /etc so we
    don't have to deal with CONFIG_PROTECT

    Fix diff code in modules_load so it can identify which functions
    have been modified

    Fix fallback mechanism in iface_start so that it works correctly
    and doesn't report a bogus error message when trying the fallback

    Get rid of need_begin trickery in iface_stop

    Simplify eend processing in dhcp modules

    Implement eindent, eoutdent, esetdent in functions.sh and adjust
    net-scripts to use them.

    Re-write einfo, ewarn, eerror, ebegin, eend, ewend to use
    RC_INDENTATION and to work better on serial terminals

    Remove conf.d/net.ppp0 since that is provided by net-dialup/ppp

  12 Oct 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Fix ipaddr_fallback in net-scripts/conf.d/net.example

  09 Oct 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Remove init.d/net.eth0 net.lo and net.ppp0.  The first two are
    provided now by net-scripts and net.ppp0 is shipped in
    net-dialup/ppp

    Create NET_FS_LIST and is_net_fs in functions.sh and use them in
    checkroot, localmount, netmount, net.example, and net.lo

  09 Oct 2004; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>:

    If the hostname has already been set via the kernel/dhcp, don't 
    force it to 'localhost'.  Used in netboot/terminal setups #38172.

    Add domainname to default boot runlevel list #47041.

  08 Oct 2004; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>:

    Make sure that when we try to mount /sys, we do so with -n (tigger).

    Add some examples for nfs to sysctl.conf #66575.

  06 Oct 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Update to net-scripts 1.0.2 from Roy
    ------------------------------------
    - wireless module: replaced preferred_only var with
      associate_order this makes more sense now as we have changed the
      possible values
    - wireless module: added patch from Daniel Zappala we should call
      wireless_get_essid everywhere now
    - wireless module: don't declare ESSID local in
      wireless_configure().  This allows ESSID to be tested in the
      user defined postup() function
    - wireless module: test type != "NOT READY!" instead of testing =
      IEEE.  this resolves problems with intel and ra-tech drivers
    - net.lo start() now errors when the interface does not exist
    - dhcpcd, dhclient, udhcpc and pump now expose peer_* vars this
      enables wireless to map them from peer_dns_ESSID
    - config-system helper now loads wireless module to remap
      variables from ESSID this allows udhcpc and dhclient to use
      remapped wireless vars
    - fixed dhcpcd and pump modules using peer_* vars
    - wireless aborts after 5 seconds if it cannot report a valid
      ESSID this fixes a potential infinite loop problem
    - wireless_setup_iface() renamed to wireless_map_essid_vars() this
      avoids confusion about what the function actually does

  06 Oct 2004; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>:

    Change the default net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter setting to 1
    in sysctl.conf since it shouldn't be harmful in anyway.  Redhat 
    does the same.

  05 Oct 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Get rid of getcols() in sbin/functions.sh.  Use COLUMNS when
    possible and otherwise clean up the COLS code.  Fix the "emerge
    depend" detection code to use RC_ENDCOL="no"

  05 Oct 2004; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>:

    Changed behavior of the domainname init.d script.  It will now 
    override any settings obtained via dhcp/whatever.  See #48277.

    Updated bootmisc to dump the output of `dmesg` to /var/log/dmesg.  
    This way users have an 'after-boot' log of their dmesg saved 
    somewhere useful #55421.

    Added the 'eend' back to depscan.sh since the script starts with a 
    call to 'ebegin' #59694.

    Add selinux update from Chris PeBenito for src/runscript.c #64019.

    Add more quoting to rc-help.sh to fix some non-critical errors.  
    Make rc-help.sh respect the value of RC_NOCOLOR.  Allow RC_NOCOLOR 
    in functions.sh to be set via the environment.

    Flesh out the default sysctl.conf with comments and more examples 
    since our previous one was pretty sparse #59993.

    Change calls to `uniq` to `sort -u` in checkroot/halt.sh.  This way 
    we only require sort in / and not both #36453.

  04 Oct 2004; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>:

    More (I mean a LOT more) services.  This takes care of #44458, 
    #52881 #55939 #58997 #66166 #66297.  Gleaned many from the IANA 
    list/Fedora/FreeBSD/Debian.

    Change the test for /proc/cmdline from -e to -r.  On grsecurity 
    based systems for example, the file may exist, but not be readable 
    by non-root users (patch by Ned Ludd).

  03 Oct 2004; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>:

    Add support for NFSv4 from #25106 to the netmount script.  Don't 
    try to fsck / if the root is a remote filesystem (like NFS) #36624.

    Update the fs_passno values in the default fstab to match the 
    settings suggested by the manpage #37314.  Make checkroot respect 
    a fs_passno setting of 0 when dealing with / #39212.  Change 
    default / filesystem type to ext3 instead of xfs #42670.

    Re-order the arguments to mount to match POSIX requirements #66225.

    Don't pipe swapon in localmount to /dev/null and ignore return 
    codes anymore.  A swapon that works shows no output #39834.

  02 Oct 2004; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>:

    Break up the COL/COLOR code properly this time.  Not all serial 
    consoles can handle adjusting to the end of the line, so let's not 
    bother running stty at all anymore.  This should fix up #32453.

  30 Sep 2004; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>:

    Disable cryptfs by default in the conf.d file.  Also cleanup 
    the output generated in localmount/checkfs/halt.sh for dm-crypt.
    Add an extra check so that cryptfs is only run when the conf.d
    file exists as well as /bin/cryptsetup.

  29 Sep 2004; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>:

    Let glibc install nscd since different versions of glibc will 
    need to be handled differently.  See #43076 by Rui Malheiro.

  29 Sep 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Prefer ~/.dir_colors over /etc/DIR_COLORS when it exists #64489

  27 Sep 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Clear the screen in .bash_logout #32330

* rc-scripts 1.6.1 (27 Sep 2004)

  27 Sep 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Update dm-crypt to work with multi-line configuration files.
    Also don't set status in a subshell; it was being lost before.

  23 Sep 2004; Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>:

   Rework the logic behind the $COLS code.  It should not depend 
   on whether color is enabled.  Also add a check for negative 
   values (like when using a serial console).

* rc-scripts 1.6.0 (15 Sep 2004)

  15 Sep 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Fix bug 64034: simplify netmount script's stop function so that
    mountpoints containing spaces work correctly

    Update tarball.sh to use net-scripts

  18 Aug 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Fix bug 60719 (request for better error messages from runscript)
    by allowing errors to show on the screen when they're encountered
    in wrap_rcscript

    Apply Spock's bootsplash patch from bug 45784.  This moves most of
    the splash functionality out of baselayout.

  13 Aug 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Don't export PS1.  Continuation of bug 26951, comments 60-62.

* rc-scripts 1.5.2 (02 Aug 2004)

  02 Aug 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Related to bug 38955, don't set INPUTRC.  Instead patch bash so
    that it looks for /etc/inputrc automatically if ~/.inputrc is
    missing.  This is better than using INPUTRC since that will
    override even after the user creates ~/.inputrc.

    Fix bug 54275: Don't set INFODIR.  The correct variable used by
    texinfo is INFOPATH, which is already set in 00basic.  Setting
    INFODIR is useless, and breaks a NetBSD cross compile from Gentoo

  01 Aug 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Fix bug 58805: net.eth0 should use bridge so that bridge
    interfaces are configured prior to net.br0 running

    Fix bug 56856: Get rid of net.rej and integrate missing stuff to
    conf.d/net

    Apply half of spock's patch in bug 45784: Check for
    conf.d/bootsplash instead of conf.d/bootsplash.conf

    Fix bug 51351: Quote parsed output of /proc/filesystems to handle
    octal sequences in mountpoint such as encoded spaces (\040)

    Fix bug 46680: Add cifs support to localmount and netmount.
    Thanks to Ronald Moesbergen for the patches

  21 Jul 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Fix bug 26952: Use /etc/bash/bashrc to setup PS1, testing $- to
    determine if shell is interactive.  The new system-wide bashrc is
    installed by bash-2.05b-r10

  19 Jul 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Fix bug 38743: strip leading and trailing spaces from variable
    values in genenviron.awk.  Thanks to Marius Mauch for the patch.

  09 Jul 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Fix bug 55576: swap words "start" and "stop" in runscript.sh error
    message

* rc-scripts 1.5.1 (28 Jun 2004)

  28 Jun 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Fix dhcp in iface_start_ifconfig: It was re-using the variable
    ${i} which would result in the following error:
        /sbin/runscript.sh: line 441: ((: 16.141.88.153: syntax error
        in expression (error token is ".141.88.153")

    Use vlan_IFACE instead of iface_IFACE_vlans in net.eth0 for more
    consistent vlan configuration.  Thanks to robbat2 in bug 55394
    (not fully resolved)

    Add example for checking if root filesystem is NFS-mounted via
    predown function in conf.d/net for bug 53104.  This might be
    better integrated at some point into net.eth0

* rc-scripts 1.5.0 (26 Jun 2004)

  26 Jun 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Fix bug 47659: support iproute2-style configuration.  Thanks to
    Dean Bailey for some fantastic patches, including documentation
    for conf.d/net.  This is a pretty huge re-write of net.eth0

    Fix bug 34607: provide examples for in conf.d/net for preup,
    postup, predown, postdown functions.  Also pay attention to return
    value from predown function (previously ignored)

  15 Jun 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Fix bug 25975: support adsl in net.eth0.  Thanks to Patrick McLean
    for the initial pass at the code.

    Fix bug 34140: add --servicelist option to rc-status.  Thanks to
    Eldad Zack for the patch.

    Fix bug 37418: fix order of LVM and RAID in checkfs.  Thanks to
    Raimondo Giammanco for the patch.

* rc-scripts 1.4.16 (06 Jun 2004)

  06 Jun 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Only call generate-modprobe.conf with --assume-kernel if
    modules-update was called with --assume-kernel.  This means that
    only catalyst has the dependency on module-init-tools, not
    everybody with the newer baselayout

* rc-scripts 1.4.15 (21 May 2004)

  21 May 2004; Aron Grifis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Fix bug 51570: typo on line 161 of /sbin/livecd-functions.sh

    on ttyB0

* rc-scripts 1.4.13 (15 May 2004)

  15 May 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Bump version to 1.4.13 to push out Gustavo's livecd serial console
    fixes for sparc and hppa.

* rc-scripts 1.4.12 (07 May 2004)

  10 May 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Bump version to 1.4.12 to release these critical bug fixes

    Fix bug 50434: The new version of start-stop-daemon changes
    directory to / by default unless --chdir is specified.  Revert
    this behavior to maintain working directory.  This fixes openvpn
    startup (probably among other things).  Thanks to Sven Wegener for
    the patch.

    Fix bug 50448: Four days ago I changed bash loops to use the wrong
    conditional syntax in net.eth0.  Thanks to Sven Wegener for
    pointing out the problem and providing a patch.

* rc-scripts 1.4.11 (07 May 2004)

  07 May 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Fix bug 20597: Skip RCS files when updating modules

    Fix bug 49926: Add a --assume-kernel flag to modules-update.  This
    requires a companion patch in module-init-tools-3.0-r2 to handle
    the same flag in generate-modprobe.conf; this dependency won't be
    handled in the baselayout ebuild since it only affects livecd
    building.

  06 May 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    In net.eth0, fix many instances of loops like "for ((i = 0; i <
    100; i = i + 1))".  The problem here is that the middle comparison
    is being interpreted as a bash conditional, which means that it's
    doing string comparison by default.  It needs to be "i -lt 100"

    Fix bug 34827: net.eth0 breaks when localized because the ifconfig
    output changes.  Wrap ifconfig in a function that overrides
    LC_ALL=C

    Fix bug 48305: Provide a new network configuration variable
    ifconfig_fallback_eth0 which allows one to specify a fallback
    configuration in case DHCP fails.

    Fix bug 50246: Give root an invalid password ("*" in /etc/shadow)
    in the default baselayout.  This prevents the first reboot after
    installation from having a blank password.

  05 May 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Fix bug 48595: Make sure $(id -u) is zero (root user) when running
    init scripts to avoid a lot of error messages.

    Replace many lines of awk with two lines of grep in
    init.d/localmount

    Fix bug 44316: Use 0644 instead of 0640 for resolv.conf in net.ppp0

  03 May 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Update to version 1.10.20 of Debian's start-stop-daemon (contained
    in dpkg at http://packages.debian.org/testing/base/dpkg).  This
    fixes bug 22686 (start-stop-daemon in baselayout doesn't allow
    altered nicelevel).

* rc-scripts 1.4.10 (25 Apr 2004)

  25 Apr 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Fix typos in sbin/rc: "try try mount" and "mount ... & >/dev/null"
    Also removed the errstr double-checking since the need for that is
    alleviated by these typo fixes.

  23 Apr 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Fix bug 48629 (/sbin/rc fixups for udev) with patch from GregKH

    Fix bug 40987 (gentoo should be able to boot with an empty /dev)
    with patch from Spanky.  The patch avoids redirection to /dev/null
    when it doesn't exist; this was breaking /sbin/rc.

* rc-scripts 1.4.9 (15 Apr 2004)

  15 Apr 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

* rc-scripts 1.4.5 (08 Apr 2004)

  08 Apr 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Patch init.d/checkroot to list / (root) only once in mtab; see bug 38360.
    Patch from Gustavoz to livecd-functions.sh to run bash instead of login on
    serial consoles, necessary due to scrambled root passwords.

* rc-scripts 1.4.4 (07 Apr 2004)

  07 Apr 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    Patch from Gustavoz for Sparc console: Fetch LIVECD_CONSOLE from dmesg
    output.  Also support 4800 baud correctly.

  16 Mar 2004; Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>:

    The changes in this commit pertain primarily to
        http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=19695
        http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=35736

    Specify routes as an array per interface, for example:
        routes_eth0=(
            "-net 10.1.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 gw 10.0.0.5"
            "-net 10.2.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 gw 10.0.0.6"
            "-host 10.3.0.1 dev eth0"
        )

    You can optionally use the gateway variable or just put the default route
    in the routes variable.  The following two are REDUNDANT:

        routes_eth0=( "default gw 10.0.0.5" )
        gateway="eth0/10.0.0.5"

    Old configuration variables in /etc/conf.d/net are fully supported and
    used transparently if ifconfig_eth0 is missing.  In other words, this new
    script is fully backward-compatible.  However you can get rid of
    iface_eth0, alias_eth0, broadcast_eth0 and netmask_eth0 if you want by
    using the new syntax:

        ifconfig_eth0=(
            "10.0.0.6 broadcast 10.0.255.255 netmask 255.255.0.0"
            "192.168.1.1 netmask 255.255.255.0"
            "123.456.789.1"
        )

    Full backward compatibility so no danger to screwing up users relying on
    existing /etc/conf.d/net setup

    NET_DEBUG can be set in the environment for copious debugging output

    Deprecate [ ] in favor of [[ ]] which has fewer quoting issues and
    better functionality (and is even slightly faster)

    Properly localize all variables, including variables returned by
    setup_vars

    Allow full options for every ifconfig command, both base address and
    aliases via ifconfig_eth0, replacing the convoluted and less-functional
    iface_eth0, alias_eth0, broadcast_eth0, netmask_eth0

    Provide full support for static routes via routes_eth0

    Fix potential quoting problems in setup_vars by using better eval syntax
    instead of eval echo

    Display IP addresses while configuring, both DHCP-retrieved and
    statically set addresses

    Collapse redundant caching of $? since eend returns $? again

    Report when keeping kernel configuration for an interface along with IP
    address gleaned

    Don't reset the default gateway if it is already set correctly

    Don't bind default gateway to particular interface when /sbin/route is
    called so that it can survive if there is more than one interface on the
    required subnet.  (Old behavior can be obtained by setting
    routes_eth0="default gw 1.2.3.4 dev eth0" if you really want it)

    Don't bomb if default gateway can't be set since that doesn't
    necessarily mean that the interface configuration is invalid.
    (Old behavior was completely broken, but commented section
    demonstrates how to do it right if necessary)

    iface_stop no longer relies on configuration in /etc/conf.d/net AT ALL.
    This is very good because it means you can put new configuration in
    /etc/conf.d/net, then restart the interface and the old configuration will
    be properly shut down.

    iface_stop reports when it is releasing the DHCP lease

* rc-scripts 1.4.3.13p1 (26 Feb 2004)

  26 Feb 2004; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Remove /etc/DIR_COLORS, as coreutils provides it now.

    Add RC_DEVICE_TARBALL to /etc/conf.d/rc to control use of device tarball.
    Also modified /sbin/rc and /etc/init.d/halt.sh for this.

    Start udevd if present.

    Small fix to sbin/rc-services.sh related to mtime checking and 'net'
    virtual service - it had no mtime generated, so check_mtime() failed
    for it ...

  25 Feb 2004; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Update to enable checking of mtimes on rc-scripts, and auto running
    depscan.sh if needed.  Also try to run depscan.sh when RC_GOT_DEPTREE_INFO
    is not set instead of just erroring.

  19 Feb 2004; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Fix irda type-o in /sbin/MAKEDEV, thanks to Tobias Sager <moixa@gmx.ch>.

    Add RC_TTY_NUMBER to /etc/conf.d/rc to configure how many tty devices
    are used in scripts such as consolefonts, numlock, etc.  This should
    close bug #39863.

    Fix type-o in /etc/init.d/consolefont, bug #40938, thanks to patch from
    Cory Tusar <ctusar@adelphia.net>.

  09 Feb 2004; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Add SELinux modifications to /sbin/runscript.  This allows runscript to
    make sure it is running in the right domain.  Patch done by
    Chris PeBenito <pebenito@gentoo.org>.

* rc-scripts 1.4.3.13 (08 Feb 2004)

  08 Feb 2004; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Fix wrong logic in /etc/init.d/halt.sh which did not umount all mounts
    _but_ /mnt/cdrom and /mnt/livecd.

    Update /etc/init.d/consolefont to use newer kbd.  Should also close
    bug #39864.

    Fix /sbin/depscan.sh, /sbin/functions.sh and /sbin/rc to use mkdir rather
    than install, as newer versions of install is located in /usr/bin.  This
    closes bug #39648.

  06 Feb 2004; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

   Tweak livecd support changes and add some more to hopefully sort out
   last issues, with help from Brad House <brad_mssw@gentoo.org>.

   Add code to generate /dev/fd, /dev/std* and /dev/core to /sbin/rc,
   bug #37349.

    Update /sbin/depscan.sh, /sbin/env-update.sh, src/awk/cachedepends.awk,
    src/awk/gendepends.awk and src/awk/genenviron.awk to use ENVIRON rather
    then gawk -v.  Also add some tests to see if we got the environment
    variables.

  28 Dec 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Fix /sbin/rc to mount /dev/pts with gid=5 and mode=0620, bug #36088.

* rc-scripts 1.4.3.12p2 (27 Dec 2003)

  26 Dec 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Update code to generate /dev from /sys.  Add UDEV_NO_SLEEP=1 for
    hack to not make udev sleep - its not needed as these entries
    are already present, and not a hotplug event.

    Update /etc/init.d/{consolefont,numlock} to work with udev managed
    /dev that have devfs layout.

  14 Dec 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Fix type-o in /sbin/rc, bug #34837.

  26 Nov 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Fix /etc/init.d/halt.sh to reset pam_console permissions, else
    the next bootup might be done with some non-root nodes which cause
    some odd issues.

    Add code to generate /dev from sysfs entries - not much it currently
    support but block/tty devices, but it is a start for when we have
    full sysfs support in all drivers.

    Revert carrier detection check, as there is currently too many
    issues with it, bug #33272.

    Make sure we mount already mounted mount (done in /sbin/rc) with
    correct permissions, etc, bug #33764.  Modified /etc/init.d/checkroot
    for this.

  16 Nov 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Fix carrier detection - we need to do a 'ifconfig $IFACE up' else
    some drivers do not set the IFF_RUNNING bit, bug #33272, thanks to
    Jason Rhinelander <jason-gentoo@gossamer-threads.com> for the fix.

  15 Nov 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Add a warning to cachedepends.awk if a rc-script's name ends in
    '.sh', bug #33134.  Add better error checking to /sbin/depscan.sh.

    Fix /etc/init.d/halt.sh to not try and remount virtual devices,
    also do a few cleanups.  Closes bug #33271.

* rc-scripts 1.4.3.12 (11 Nov 2003)

  11 Nov 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Add carrier detection to /etc/init.d/net.eth0 closing bug #25480;

    Add extra checks for critical directories to /sbin/rc.

  04 Nov 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Update /bin/rc-status giving a working '-u' parameter, bug #32417.
    Fix by Michael Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>.

  31 Oct 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Add support for --tty switch added to setfont and remove consolechars
    support; modified /etc/init.d/consolefont for this.  Also remove
    consoletools support from /etc/init.d/keymaps.

  29 Oct 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    We should still use /sbin/udev as hotplug agent if /sbin/hotplug do
    not exist.  Updated /sbin/rc for this.

    Add a fix to /etc/init.d/keymaps for bug #32111 (we should not have
    '-u' in the call to loadkeys when using unicode).

    We should not use '-' in variable names for bash, bug #31184, thanks
    to Andreas Simon <yuipx@gmx.net>.  Updated /sbin/MAKEDEV.

  27 Oct 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Fix return code checking of fsck in /etc/init.d/checkfs, bug #31349.

  26 Oct 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    The unmount stuff in /etc/init.d/halt.sh was flawed, in the fact that
    it called 'umount -t no<insert_fs_here>', which resulted in /proc, etc
    unmounted anyhow.  Change it to remount the last filesystems readonly
    without trying to unmount any.  This fixes a few cases where reboot
    would halt due to unmounted /proc, etc.

    This change set fixes two things:
    1)  In exporting all functions/variables in functions.sh, rc-services.sh
       and rc-daemon.sh, we created an overly large environment, and also
       broke stuff like glftpd.  Do not do this, and hope whatever caused
       the issues previously is fixed in the meantime.  This should close
       bugs #25754 and #31794.
    2)  gendepend.awk used to generate deptree with functions called
       depinfo_<scriptname> which set appropriate variables when called.
       This broke if the scriptname contained characters that is not valid
       for bash variable names.  Changed things to use an array fixing this.
       This closes bug #24092.

    Change /sbin/rc again to not set the hotplug agent to /sbin/udev, as
    /sbin/hotplug will call udev as well.

    Fix a logic error in /lib/rcscripts/sh/rc-services.sh that cause the
    get_dep_info() function to skip the last entry in the RC_DEPEND_TREE
    array (in my case 'net').

    We did not handle the 'net' dependency properly in valid_iuse() and
    valid_iafter().  Fix this in /lib/rcscripts/sh/rc-services.sh, closing
    bugs #30327 and #31950.

    Change an occurance of /etc/modutils in modules-update.8 to
    /etc/modules.d/ closing bug #31171.

  19 Oct 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    More bootsplash fixes, bug #21019 (comment #21).

    Remove the killall5 stuff from /etc/init.d/halt.sh, as it messes with
    bootsplash.  Add support to kill processes still using non-critical
    mounts with fuser though.

  17 Oct 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Bootsplash fixes from Michael Aichler <micha@aichler.net>, (comment #15
    and #16 from bug #21019).

    Bootsplash coded did not play nice with boot profiles, so I fixed that
    as well.  Some other style tweaks.

    Fix /sbin/MAKEDEV to use 'user:group' form, and not depriciated '.'.
    Also changed the permissions on tty's, ibcs and scanner devices
    to 0660.

* rc-scripts 1.4.3.11p2 (14 Sep 2003)

  14 Oct 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    It now will work with runlevels named with any characters (other than
    ones found in default bash IFS).  It also adds a few sanity/error
    checks, bug #26432.

    Change /etc/inputrc to have PageUp/PageDown search through bash
    history again, bug #26036.

  14 Sep 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Fix get_bootparam() in /sbin/functions.sh to check for existance of
    the /proc/cmdline proc entry.
    
  10 Aug 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Modify /etc/init.d/halt.sh to first kill, and then deactivate swap on
    request of Luke-Jr <luke-jr@gentoo.org>.  It should be ok now, as the
    whole way of devfs handling changed long ago already.

    Fix /etc/init.d/halt.sh to unmount the mount point and not the device.
    Also change it to 'mount -d' to detach the loop device.  Patch by
    Kalin KOZHUHAROV <kalin@ThinRope.net>, bug #26256.

    Fix /etc/init.d/consolefont to not error out if CONSOLEFONT in rc.conf
    is not set, bug #26278 (noted by Michael Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>).

* rc-scripts 1.4.3.10 (04 Aug 2003)

  04 Aug 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Add /bin/rc-status and 'show' support to /sbin/rc-update (long overdue),
    bug #4222, thanks to Sean E Russell <ser@germane-software.com>,
    Michael Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org> (/bin/rc-status) and for the 'show'
    stuff to /sbin/rc-update, Max Kalika <max@gentoo.org>.

    Fixed modules-update to only do the /etc/modprobe.conf generation if we
    are actually running a 2.5+ kernel.

    Add pop3 entries to /etc/services, bug #25501.

    Add a switch for devfsd startup to /etc/conf.d/rc, fix /sbin/rc to check
    RC_DEVFSD_STARTUP.  Closes bug #24361, thanks to patches from
    Kurt V. Hindenburg <khindenburg@cherrynebula.net>.

    Add LVM2 support thanks to Max Kalika <max@gentoo.org> (bug #21908).

    Add IPV6 versions of localhost and co in /etc/hosts, bug #25859.

    Fix type-o in /sbin/rc-update, bug #25854.

  29 Jul 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Tweak /etc/init.d/check{root,fs} to set retval after each fsck call,
    and not the whole block.  Tweak check checkroot to reboot if need be
    (This is with sufficient warning and message).  Tweak checkfs to not
    drop to a sulogin if return code 2 or 3 is given - as we did not
    mount the filesystems yet, we should not need to reboot ... bug #25398.

    Add '-T' option to fsck (/etc/init.d/check{root,fs} - requested by
    Michael Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>.

  28 Jul 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Rework changes for the Adelie project to support boot config profiles
    better.  Added support for /etc/runlevels/LEVEL/.fake to specify which
    runlevels should be marked started or stopped without executing the
    script.  Renamed the /etc/runlevels/LEVEL/critical to ".critical" for
    more uniformity.  Modified /sbin/rc, /sbin/functions.sh, /sbin/runscript.sh
    for this.

    Add better support for services that provide the "logger" virtual.  We
    should really start the logger earlier, and stop it as late as possible.
    Modified /sbin/rc, /lib/rcscripts/sh/rc-services.sh and gendepends.awk
    for this.

    Fix .../boot/... paths hardcoded in /lib/rcscripts/sh/rc-services.sh,
    thanks to Jean-Francois Richard <jean-francois@richard.name>.

    Replace the Suse /etc/inputrc with a non copyrighted one, bug #24918.

  23 Jul 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    From Jean-Francois Richard <jean-francois@richard.name> and
    Olivier Crete <tester@gentoo.org> from the Adelie project:

      The last four patches are the "adaptation" of our previous patches to
      the new "no-tmpfs" init system in Gentoo.  Since we were using quite
      different scripts for the boot runlevel (no "checkroot" for example) and
      that the new system hardcodes some of the boot services, we had to find
      a simple yet elegant solution.

      We chose to make init scripts read "/etc/runlevels/LEVEL/critical" to
      know what are the boot runlevel services.  If this file is not present,
      it uses the Gentoo hardcoded defaults.

    This touches /sbin/rc, /sbin/functions.sh, /sbin/runscript.sh and
    /etc/init.d/halt.sh.

    I just changed the behaviour of 'softlevel' kernel command line argument
    to not only add a suffix and some other cleanups.

    Add support for irqbalance.

  22 Jul 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Fix the /dev/root entry in /etc/mtab, bug #24916.

    Andy Dustman <andy-gentoo.54e552@dustman.net>.

    Add 'TERM=Eterm' to /etc/DIR_COLORS, bug #23423.

    Add mdadm support to /etc/init.d/checkfs, bug #23437, many thanks
    to Wes Kurdziolek <wkurdzio@vtluug.org>.

    Rather use 'uname -r' to get kernel version, as else we need sysctl.
    This closes bug #23923, modified /etc/init.d/modules.

    Fix a type-o in /etc/fstab, bug #23308.

    Add support for the new 'O' agetty option to display the DNS domainname
    in the issue file thanks to Marius Mauch <genone@genone.de>, bug #22275.
    Updated /etc/issue and /etc/issue.logo for this.

    thanks to splite <splite-gentoo@sigint.cs.purdue.edu>.

    Fix /sbin/functions.sh to disable color printing if NOCOLOR is set to
    "true" in /etc/make.conf, closing bug #24107.

    Fix /etc/init.d/keymaps to be more non-x86 friendly, and also allow
    more keymaps to be specified in /etc/rc.conf, bug #24084.

    have 'bind' mounts for /proc in fstab as well, bug #21068.

    Fix /etc/init.d/bootmisc to check for /sbin/env-update.sh, bug #21384,
    reported by Gunnlaugur Thor Briem <gthb@hi.is>.

    Add 'before bootmisc' to /etc/init.d/domainname, as we need to start
    it before 'env-update.sh' gets run by /etc/init.d/bootmisc.

* rc-scripts 1.4.3.8p1 (21 May 2003)

  21 May 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Last fix I did not use the modified 'myservice', but used $1 again,
    causing the network dependencies to bork.  I did not notice this
    as I have net.eth0 in default runlevel.

* rc-scripts 1.4.3.8 (20 May 2003)

  20 May 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    A '-' in a bash variable is not valid as well.  Fix gendepend.awk and
    rc-service.sh to handle this, thanks to YAMAKURA Makoto
    <makoto@dsb.club.ne.jp>.

    Move /etc/issue to /etc/issue.logo, and have /etc/issue only print info
    about the host it is running on.

  18 May 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Do not let devfsd handle /dev/log's permission management, as it breaks
    selinux.  Modified /etc/devfsd.conf, changes submited by Chris PeBenito
    <pebenito@gentoo.org>.

    Fix type-o in /etc/init.d/net.ppp0, and add local ip-up/ip-down support.

    We should not export the RC_GOT_* variables, as it breaks on some systems,
    thanks to J?rg Gollnick <gentoo-bugs@wurzelbenutzer.de>, bug #20851.

    From C. Brewer <killian@gentoo.org>:
    - Add hide-password to the connect cmd-line of /etc/init.d/net.ppp0, which is
      suppose to be default, but why take chances?
    - Also, echoing chmod 640 in the resolv.conf two-step at the end to solve the
      kppp complaint.

  13 May 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    For the network functions, the dependency code tried to create a funcion
    with a '.' in the name, causing the network rc-scripts to not have any
    dependencies.  This should fix bug #20849 's order issue, thanks to
    YAMAKURA Makoto <makoto@dsb.club.ne.jp> for noticing.

    Fix query_{before,after} to also check 'net' if 'service2' is a network
    service.

  12 May 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    More cleanups:
    - Move the broken stuff from symlinks to a DB entry in ${svcdir}/deptree.
      Updated /sbin/runscript.sh, /sbin/rc-services.sh and gendepend.awk for
      this.
    - Add functions for more common tasks in /sbin/runscript.sh to
      /sbin/rc-services.sh.
    - Move 'consoletype' to /sbin.
    - Rename /sbin/rc-envupdate.sh to /sbin/env-update.sh; updated
      /etc/init.d/bootmisc for this.
    - Move rc-services.sh, rc-daemon.sh and rc-help.sh to /lib/rcscripts/sh.
    - Improve detection of circular depends ... modified gendepend.awk for this.

* rc-scripts 1.4.3.7 (11 May 2003)

  11 May 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Too many things to remember, so here is changes of note:
    - More changes to gendepend.awk.  This basically modifies it to not use
      symlinks in $svcdir/{need,use,before,after,provide} anymore, but rather
      create a file that can be sourced.  Seems to speedup things nicely.
    - Add /sbin/rc-services.sh.  This is basically a module to get dependency
      info from the new $svcdir/deptree, and some other new service functions.
    - Modify the whole works to *only* source all needed files once.  This
      includes /sbin/{functions.sh,rc-services.sh,rc-daemon.sh}.  Also
      rc-services.sh will only source $svcdir/deptree once.  /sbin/runscript.sh
      is sourced more than once (actually each time a service is started or
      stopped, but is is cut down much).  Also seems to speed things up again.
    - Fix a long outstanding bug in gendepend.awk that caused the 'net'
      dependency to not be actually used in shutdown, causing the services
      needing it to be stoped before net.* services.
    - Add the RC_PARALLEL_STARTUP variable, with schedule_service_startup() to
      /sbin/rc-services.sh and /etc/conf.d/rc.  This is experimental parallel
      startup of services, and seems to work nicely.  Only issues to date is
      that printing of messages is not synced, and a race very intermittantly
      that causes a service to be started when it was already scheduled.
    - Add a new dependency type 'parallel' that can be used to control if a
      service can be started in paralled or not.  Possible arguments is "yes"
      or "no"; if it is not present, it is considered as "yes":

      depend() {
          parallel yes|no
      }
      
      Modified cachedepend.awk, gendepend.awk and /sbin/rc-services.sh.
    - Fix the 'single' runlevel to actually work properly, and without a
      /etc/runlevels/single directory.
    - Remove the BOOT variable, and update /sbin/rc to set SOFTLEVEL properly.
      Fix /etc/init.d/{checkroot,bootmisc} to use SOFTLEVEL instead of BOOT.

  08 May 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Major rework of /lib/rcscript/awk/gendepend.awk, cleaning it up nicely,
    and adding more sanity checks.

  04 May 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Revert /etc/init.d/hostname the way it was, as it should be the user's
    choice if he want to have a FQDN in there or not, bug #14946.

    Add /etc/init.d/domainname for those that want to use it.

  29 Apr 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Change the root check back the way it was, else it breaks with non bash
    shells;  modified /etc/profile.

  29 Apr 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Change test in /etc/profile for root to '[ "$EUID" -eq 0 ]', bug #20140.

  27 Apr 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Add various patches from Rachel Holmes <rach@gmx.net>:

      Dropped use of 'cat' in bash scripts, '$(<$file)' is there for that
      purpose.  Modified:
    
        /etc/init.d/net.ppp0
        /etc/init.d/nscd
        /sbin/functions.sh
        /sbin/rc
        /sbin/rc-daemon.sh
        /sbin/rc-envupdate.sh.bash
        /sbin/runscript.sh

      Exchanged some gratuitous use of awk for grep. Awk is a little resource
      hungry just for a simple test. (I [azarah] did not apply the changes to
      tests for 'devfs', as having 'usbdevfs' in the equation will break
      things).  Modified /sbin/rc for this.

      Gentoo enforces having /proc, so uname -r is a little redundant when the
      information is available without an external command.  Modified:

        /etc/init.d/modules
        /etc/init.d/serial
        /sbin/functions.sh
        /sbin/modules-update

      Changed 'id -u' commands to use $EUID in bash executed scripts, same
      result no extra command.  Modified:

        /sbin/rc-envupdate.sh
        /sbin/rc-envupdate.sh.bash
        /sbin/rc-update

      Removed all the cat sections, and the separate echo sections.  The output
      is _exactly_ the same, minus some spare spaces that have been removed.
      Fourfold speed increase in the (granted flimsy) tests I have done.
      Modified /sbin/rc-help.sh for this.

      Final remaining 'cat' commands removed, in favour of using bash's internal
      '$(< )' or 'echo'.  Use of echo leads the way to future support for bash's
      i18n anyway.  Modified:

        /sbin/rc
        /sbin/rc-envupdate.sh
        /sbin/rc-envupdate.sh.bash



* rc-scripts 1.4.3.6 (27 Apr 2003)

  27 Apr 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Add a 'save' function /etc/init.d/clock, bug #19685.

    Add a slocate group to /etc/group, bug #19604.

    Do not stop a network service if we do not reboot on runlevel change,
    as it could have been started by the user or hotplug.  This should
    address bug #12763; modified /sbin/rc for this.

    Fix /etc/init.d/hostname to set only the hostname, and not the NIS
    domainname.

    Fix /etc/init.d/keymaps to be able to set the extended keymap in rc.conf.
    This should close bug #16884.

    Fix /etc/profile to be /bin/sh compadible, bug #18918.

    Change the swap comments in /sbin/rc to "Activating (possible) swap" to
    be more 'generic' ?  Only try to disable swap if any devices/files was
    activated.  This should close bug #19089.

    Fix /etc/init.d/checkroot to only remount / rw if not set explicitly to
    rw in /etc/fstab, bug #19158.

  24 Apr 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Fix /etc/init.d/net.ppp0 to do the right thing if stopped was called,
    but the ppp link was already down, bug #15333.

  12 Apr 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Fix type-o in /etc/init.d/consolefont (line 38 should be 'retval=$?').
    Thanks to  Matt Taylor <liverbugg@juno.com> (comment #6, bug #18344).

    From linux-2.5.68, we need to mount devpts on /dev/pts again ...
    updated /sbin/rc for this.

  11 Apr 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Fix errors on sourcing /etc/profile if EDITOR is not set, bug #18995.

  10 Apr 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Make checking in unmount more strict, fixing bug #19007.

  09 Apr 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Add one more check to genenviron.awk, to spot cases where there is a
    space between the variable and the '='.

  08 Apr 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Fix interactive shell not to have coloured prompt when used as a
    dumb client, bug #18886.  Fix was inspired by patch from
    Matthew Kennedy <mkennedy@gentoo.org>.

* rc-scripts 1.4.3.5 (06 Apr 2003)

  06 Apr 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Hopefully get the serial support sane again.  Added /bin/consoletype
    from Redhat to check for serial console.  This should resolve bug
    #18329 partly.

    Add the --nocolor option to suppress the use of colors.

    Change the 'status' option to return true if the service is running,
    and false if stopped.  This is only if the '--quiet' flag was also
    given.

    Change the start and stop options not to output or return false if
    the '--quiet' flag was given.

    Redirect stderr for consolechars in /etc/init.d/consolefont to /dev/null
    as well, fixing bug #18344.

    Optimize $EDITOR extraction in /etc/profile closing bug #18614, thanks to
    Aron Griffis <agriffis@gentoo.org>.

    Set HALT to 'shutdown' or 'reboot' depending on if we are shutting down
    or rebooting.

  30 Mar 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Fix bug #18329 ... $COLS was not setup properly for serial console.

  24 Mar 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Optimize USB fs stuff in /etc/init.d/localmount to use less cats etc.
    Fix a problem where it might not have mounted the USB fs when usbcore
    was compiled as module, and the kernel did not mount it by the time
    the script was started.  Get it to rather check what filesystems is
    supported when deciding if it should use 'usbdevfs' or 'usbfs', as
    later 2.4 kernels now also support the newer 'usbfs'.

    Optimize RAID stuff in /etc/init.d/checkfs a bit.

  16 Mar 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Update sbin/rc-envupdate.sh.bash for bug #17549.

  16 Mar 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Add /etc/issue done by a Polish ascii-artists, v|rus with some slight
    modifications (purple and display hostname, etc).  Closes bug #16806.

    Add 'use hotplug' to /etc/init.d/net.eth0, to get cardbus hardware to
    work properly.  Closes bug #17348.

    Add update from Wout Mertens <wmertens@gentoo.org> to speedup shutdown
    of dhcp interfaces, closing bug #17378.  This modified /etc/init.d/net.eth0.

  11 Mar 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Fix usage of /usr/bin/cut in /sbin/functions.sh, thanks Brandon Low
    <lostlogic@gentoo.org>!

  10 Mar 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Add sysfs support for 2.5 kernels (mounted to /sys).  Updated /sbin/rc
    and /etc/init.d/halt.sh for this.

    Update /etc/fstab to correctly mount /proc with:
    
      mount -t proc none /proc

    Do the same for /dev/shm:

      mount -t tmpfs none /dev/shm

    Fix a typeo in /etc/init.d/checkroot that caused 'umount -a' to output
    noise if we exited a recovery console.

    Fix /etc/init.d/hostname using /usr/bin/cut, closing bug #17175, thanks
    to Bobby Bingham <uhmmmm@columbus.rr.com> for noticing this.

    Bring down default gateway before adding new one .. this fixes issues
    where eth0/whatever was brought up by kernel.  Changed /etc/init.d/net.eth0
    for this, closing bug #17164.  Thanks to nth <y.lesaint@free.fr> for the
    fix.

    Add support to /etc/init.d/modules to use /etc/modules.autoload/kernel-2.4
    if we are using a 2.4 kernel, and /etc/modules.autoload/kernel-2.5 if we
    are using a 2.5 kernel ... bug #17109.

  02 Mar 2003; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    in /etc/conf.d/rc to change this back to the old default.
    This is the start to address bug #2706.

* rc-scripts 1.4.2.4 (26 Nov 2002)

  26 Nov 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Initial merge of bits for Adelie Linux for SSI clusters.  More
    info at:

      http://www.cerca.umontreal.ca/hpc/en/projects/adelie/index.html

  25 Nov 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    One liner fix to src/awk/cachedepends.awk to once again fix
    bug #7803.

  18 Nov 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Add 'alias char-major-89    i2c-dev' to /etc/modules.d/aliases.
    This should close bug #10891.

* rc-scripts 1.4.2.3 (18 Nov 2002)

  18 Nov 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Add some more checks to src/awk/*.  Fix error printing for
    /sbin/depscan.sh.

    Link awk module with gcc and not with ld.  This should fix
    problems on sparc and alpha.  Many thanks for this fix to
    Stephan Jones <cretin@gentoo.org>.

    Remove the copyright info from config files, thanks to
    Matthew Kennedy <mkennedy@gentoo.org>.

* rc-scripts 1.4.2.2 (18 Nov 2002)

  18 Nov 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Add src/awk/genenviron.awk which is rc-envupdate.sh ported
    to awk.  This is also much faster than its bash version.

    Remove the 'Spider cat fix' from depscan.sh.bash, as it makes
    things even slower on older boxes.  Bug #10548.

    After a bored Vapier decided that he needed to update the
    licenses of things in /etc :P, I did the rest.  Hopefully
    not too many people will nuke thier fstab :/

* rc-scripts 1.4.2.1 (18 Nov 2002)

  18 Nov 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Update src/awk/cachedepends.awk to find its own rc-scripts,
    fixing the need for find which broke systems with /usr on
    a different partition.

  17 Nov 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Add some extra checks to src/awk/cachedepends.awk and
    src/awk/gendepends.awk.

    Move some of the more generic functions in src/awk/gendepends.awk
    to src/awk/functions.awk.

* rc-scripts 1.4.2 (17 Nov 2002)

  17 Nov 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Add initial version of new depscan.sh.  This uses awk scripts
    to do the main work, giving about 10 times speed improvement on
    slower machines.  Updated /sbin/depscan.sh, src/filefuncts.c,
    src/Makefile, src/awk/cachedepends.awk and src/awk/gendepends.awk
    for this.  This should close bug #10548.

* rc-scripts 1.4.1.2 (5 Nov 2002)

  5 Nov 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Add UID/GID of 250 for Portage Fakeroot account.

  4 Nov 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Change /etc/init.d/clock to depend on localmount again, fixing
    bug #10048.

    Get deps on logger sane again.  I wanted to get the logger started
    as early as possible, but clock for one breaks if /usr is mounted
    on seperate partition.

  29 Oct 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Fix return in /etc/init.d/modules to return 0 if /proc/modules
    do not exists.  Closes bug #7738, comment #5.

* rc-scripts 1.4.1.1 (28 Oct 2002)

  28 Oct 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Fix /sbin/update-modules not to include backup files.  Closes
    bug #9707.

  26 Oct 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Fix update-modules borking if there are directories present
    in /etc/modules.d/.  Closes bug #9632.

  17 Oct 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Change deps on /etc/init.d/{clock,hostname,modules} not to
    depend on localmount, but rather on checkroot, as all of them
    just need / to be mounted.  This should fix race conditions
    because of checkfs dependency on modules.  This should close
    bug #9266.

* rc-scripts 1.4.1 (13 Oct 2002)

  13 Oct 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Create and fix permissions on /tmp/.{ICE,X11}-unix/.  This
    is additional measures for bug #8281.

  12 Oct 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Update /etc/init.d/net.eth0 to fix bug #8626.

    Fix /sbin/rc-update to check return code of "ln".  This should
    close bug #8867.

  29 Sep 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Fix indentation in /etc/inputrc.  This should close
    bug #8368.

    Add extended status functionality.  Should close bug #2462.

    Add support for /sbin/rc-update to check if the rc-script
    is executable or not.  Thanks to widersacher@gmx.net, closing
    bug #8326.

  25 Sep 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Fix /etc/init.d/bootmisc not to kill pidfiles of running
    daemons.  Improve NGPT support in /sbin/rc a bit.

  23 Sep 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Fix my last screwup with /etc/init.d/net.ppp0.  Basically
    forgot to change a few DEVICE's to IFACE ...

  22 Sep 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    NGPT support.

  17 Sep 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Did a small fix to /etc/init.d/net.eth0, thanks to
    naanyaar2000@yahoo.com, bug #7407.

  16 Sep 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Add the permission stuff for generic scsi when compiled as
    module, thanks to Bauno <bauno@inwind.it>.

    Add support for /etc/devfs.d/ for additional devfs config
    stuff .. idea from Denys Duchier <Denys.Duchier@ps.uni-sb.de>.

  11 Sep 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Fix small type-o from last changes to /etc/init.d/netmount.
    Should resolve bug #7803.

* rc-scripts 1.4.0 (7 Sep 2002)

  7 Sep 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Update /etc/init.d/net.eth0 to handle individual broadcast
    and netmask for aliases.  Should close bug #7407.

    Give /var/run/utmp and /var/log/wtmp the proper permissions
    and ownership.  First steps in fixing bug #7630.

    Change Raid stuff again in /etc/init.d/checkfs.

  26 Aug 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org>:

    Give root a 'root' GECOS in /etc/passwd, was NULL before.

* rc-scripts 1.3.9 (25 Aug 2002)

  25 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Update /sbin/rc to fix some spelling/slang mistakes.  Closes
    bug #6887.

    Move /etc/init.d/net.ppp0 's config to /etc/conf.d/net.ppp0.
    This closes bug #6378.

    Add IPv6 support to /etc/init.d/net.eth0.  Closes bug #6175,
    with many thanks to Asbjorn Sannes <ace@sannes.org>.

    Update /etc/init.d/bootmisc to reset pam_console permissions.
    
    Update /etc/devfsd.conf to have the "pam_console_apply_devfsd.so"
    line for getting devfs to work with pam_console.

  12 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Update /etc/init.d/keymaps to first load the windowkeys.inc then
    the user selected one, fixing bug #6295.

  11 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Change the 'cat' in check_rcscript() to a single 'awk' in
    /sbin/depscan.sh.  This should fix broken pipe issues if the
    loop exists too early.  Resolves bug #5961.

    Fix software RAID startup/shutdown, bug #5310.  Modified
    /etc/init.d/checkfs and /etc/init.d/halt.sh for this.

* rc-scripts 1.3.8 (08 Aug 2002)

   7 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Move the color ls stuff to .bashrc.  Fix bug #5250.

   6 Aug 2002; Dan Armak <danarmak@gentoo.org>:
   
    Correct the comments in rc.conf about the XSESSION variable: it should
    be set to "kde-<version>" not "KDE". Closes bug #5948.

   5 Aug 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Fix the 'Usage' line in the help to return the correct options for
    the script (/sbin/runscript.sh).  Resolve bug #6029.

   3 Aug 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org>:

    Added UPS shutdown support for nut to halt.sh.
    Added nut user/group as uid/gid 84.

  27 Jul 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Updated /sbin/rc's way of checking for devfs support (now rather uses
    awk, as it is more accurate).  Closes bug #5458.

    Add the Redhat/Mandrake /forcefsck and /fastboot options to our checkroot
    and checkfs.  Updated /etc/init.d/{checkroot,checkfs,halt.sh} for this.
    Thanks goes to Chris PeBenito (bug #5570).

    Changed most daemons to use /bin/false as shell.  Should close bug #5388.

  27 Jul 2002; Nicholas Jones <carpaski@gentoo.org>:
    
    Added vpopmail user and group as 89:89

  22 Jul 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Add the cyrus user to /etc/passwd.  Resolves bug #4100.

    Some bugfixes and speed improvements to /sbin/depscan.sh after
    last changes.

    Replace some cat/grep's in /sbin/rc-envupdate.sh with awk's to
    get some speed improvements.

  21 Jul 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Fix LVM support in /etc/init.d/checkfs again, thanks to help from
    Kyle Manna <nitro@gentoo.org>.

    Add software RAID support to /etc/init.d/checkfs, thanks to
    Daniel Ahlberg <aliz@gentoo.org>.

    Update the cache_depend() funtion in /sbin/depscan.sh not to
    quit on any "}", but only on the one matching the first "{". This
    requires wc in /bin, so baselayout should depend on
    >=sys-apps/textutils-2.0.19-r2

    Update /etc/init.d/netmount to try and detect nfs mounts that should be
    mounted automatically on boot.  This requires awk in /bin, so baselayout
    should depend on >=sys-apps/gawk-3.1.0-r3.

* rc-scripts 1.3.7 (17 Jul 2002)

  17 Jul 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Add logging functionality to the rc-scripts, thanks to Alexander Holler,
    bug #4037 for the basic idea.  Updated /sbin/functions.sh for this.

  16 Jul 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Add additional entries to /etc/services to support cyrus-imapd, thanks
    to Nick Hadaway <raker@gentoo.org>.

    Update /etc/init.d/consolefont to resolve bug #4968.  This fixes a
    problem with non 7bit ascii symbols.

    Updated /etc/init.d/checkfs to detect if lvm is already active.
    This should resolve bug #3613.

  5 Jun 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Add "usb" group, gid 85.  Move "sshd" user and group to 22.  Move
    "games" user and group to 35

  3 Jun 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Update Copyright displayed at boot, thanks to Sascha Schwabbauer
    (aka cybersystem).  Updated /sbin/rc for this.

  30 Jun 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Update /etc/skel/.bashrc to update the window title of X terminals
    that supports it.  Closes bug #4232.

  26 Jun 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Add sshd user and group.  Updated /etc/passwd and /etc/group for this.

    Update /etc/inputrc to resolve bug #2599.

  20 Jun 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Add /opt/bin to $PATH and $ROOTPATH, closing bug #3603.  Modified
    /etc/env.d/00basic for this.

    Add some new daemon stop and pid detection stuff to /sbin/functions.sh.
    Nothing official, but I spent enough time on it not to want to loose it :)

    Fixed a bug in /sbin/functions.sh that caused rc-scripts run as cron jobs
    to give output to stderr.  This was caused by a call to "stty", which when
    run without a attatched terminal, have this effect.  Basically just pipe
    stderr to /dev/null.

  5 Jun 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Add /usr/local/share/man to $MANPATH (/etc/env.d/00basic), resolving
    bug #3363

  26 May 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Update /etc/init.d/netmount not to try and mount NFS filesystems
    if portmap was not started.  This is to stop "hang" problems for
    new users who do not add portmap to the default runlevel.  See
    bug #2555.

    Add the video4linux stuff to /etc/devfsd.conf.  Resolves bug #2015.

  19 May 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Move $EDITOR from /etc/profile to /etc/env.d/00basic.

  13 May 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Change the homes of user "at" and "cron" in /etc/passwd, as
    they moved to /var/spool/cron...

* rc-scripts 1.3.5 (12 May 2002)

  12 May 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Make slight modifications to /sbin/depscan.sh to improve speed (about
    1 second on a celeron 633).

    Finally fix /sbin/runscript.sh to properly handle interdependencies
    between types need/use and before/after on runlevel change.  I can
    actually kick myself for previous implementations, as this fix simplifies
    things a lot, and is almost 30 lines of code less!

    Change /etc/init.d/netmount not to fail if all mounts are not mounted.
    It rather just exit with a warning, as I think most people have like
    me mounts that are to boxes that are not always up.

    Resolve bug #2439 (should not use try with the dd command for ramdisk
    stuff).  Also increase the number of inodes used for the ramdisk to
    fix "out of space" errors.  Updated /sbin/rc for this.

  10 May 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Resolve bug #2505 ... /sbin/rc-envupdate.sh should not use
    backup files to generate /etc/profile.env.

    Resolve bug #2489 and #2175.  Modified /etc/init.d/net.eth0
    for this.

  6 May 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Fixed /sbin/rc-envupdate.sh to only use the $KDEDIR of the highest
    /etc/env.d/ file.  Same for $QTDIR.

  5 May 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Add /etc/DIR_COLORS as it is no longer shipped with fileutils,
    and is needed for some fixes.

  28 Apr 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Update /etc/rc.conf to be more clear and state that you should
    remove consolefont from startup if you do not use it.  Should
    resolve bug #2174.

  26 Apr 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> passwd, group :

    Added user/group apache with uid/gid 81.

  25 Apr 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:
  
    Remove the "-net" from the line setting the default gateway
    in /etc/init.d/net.eth0.  Thanks to Peter W. Michaleas for
    noting this.

  24 Apr 2002; Donny Davies <woodchip@gentoo.org> rc.conf :

    Remove NFSSERVER from rc.conf since it's now covered in /etc/conf.d/nfs
    which is installed with the nfs-utils package.  Also tidied up some
    really old, leftover junk like the non-supported stuff from rc5.
    Closes #1754.

  23 Apr 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Remove creation of /var/run/utmpx from bootmisc again.  Seems
    other people have wierd problems.

* rc-scripts 1.3.4 (21 Apr 2002)

  21 Apr 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Add /sbin/rc-envupdate.sh to speedup updating of /etc/profile.env,
    and /etc/csh.env.  Update /etc/init.d/bootmisc to use this.

    Implement the status commandline argument.  Updated /sbin/runscript.sh
    and /sbin/rc-help.sh for this.

    Fix /sbin/depscan.sh to honour NEED and USE overriding BEFORE
    and AFTER.

  12 Apr 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Update /etc/init.d/bootmisc to create /var/run/utmpx. This
    is needed, else /usr/bin/newgrp segfault.

  11 Apr 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Update /etc/skel/.bash_profile to make it tcsh compadible.
    Thanks to Väinö Järvelä for this fix.

    Update /etc/profile to also set the PS? variables if $SHELL
    is set to /bin/sh.  This should make prompt colours in
    bootstrap work again.

    Move LVM stuff to checkfs to ensure that they get fscked.
    This resolves bug #1552.

* rc-scripts 1.3.3 (5 Apr 2002)

  5 Apr 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Move /etc/init.d/{depscan.sh,runscript.sh,functions.sh} to /sbin.
    This is done to try and ensure system integrity.

  1 Apr 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Add quotes to the "export INPUTRC=/etc/inputrc" line to resolve bug #1391.

    Add a error message to /etc/init.d/consolefont, resolving bug #1415.

    Add a bash check to the code that sets the prompt, fixing bug #1078.

* rc-scripts 1.3.2 (24 Mar 2002)

  24 Mar 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Resolve bug #1274.  Updated /etc/init.d/hostname and /etc/init.d/bootmisc
    for this.

    With the "before" and "after" stuff, recursion levels was getting too high,
    and with some cases, things just plain did not work as it should.  Reworked
    things to to lower the levels of recursion and get the order right.  Updated
    /etc/init.d/runscript.sh for this.

    Fixed a problem in /sbin/rc and /etc/init.d/runscript.sh where
    ${svcdir}/softlevel did not always exist, but runscript.sh tried to open it.

    Enhance --quiet support.  Updated /etc/init.d/functions.sh for this.

    Remove /etc/pwdb.conf, as pwdb already install a copy of this.

    Remove /etc/pam.d/{rexec,rlogin,rsh} as pam already install this.

    Added $INPUTRC to /etc/profile, since too many people keep on bugging me,
    and it seems it has fallen now to my discression.

* rc-scripts 1.3.1 (23 Mar 2002)

  23 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: init.d/net.eth0: fix for
  DHCP lease release from Jim Nutt.
  
  23 Mar 2002; Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: rolling a new release
  since there are a lot of important bug fixes in here that are needed.

  23 Mar 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Resolve bug #1292.

    Remove the extra 'depmod -a' in /etc/init.d/modules, thanks to
    Spidler.

  21 Mar 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Update /sbin/rc to fix a 'cat mounts' instead of the correct
    version, 'cat /proc/mounts'.

  19 Mar 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Add initial support for the --quiet flag that suppress output.

  18 Mar 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Remove the 'try' from 'try /etc/init.d/depscan.sh' in /sbin/rc
    as not all errors by depscan.sh is critical.  It should be
    reworked to do better error handeling.

  14 Mar 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Fix the GID and UID of nobody and nogroup in /etc/passwd and
    /etc/group to match those of Debian, FBSD and others.  Thanks
    to those who reported it, and Woodchip for looking up the
    proper values.

    Update /etc/init.d/net.eth0 to properly down DHCP interfaces.
    This resolves bug #1150, thanks to Paul Fleischer.

  11 Mar 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:

    Updated /etc/init.d/functions.sh not to use /usr/bin/basename,
    as some users have /usr on seperate partition which is not
    mounted when depscan.sh is run the first time.

    Updated the checking for more than one service providing the
    same virtual function in /etc/init.d/depscan.sh.  It should
    be working now, and this also fix a problem that when there is no
    service providing a virtual, counter was used uninitialized.

* rc-scripts 1.3.0 (10 Mar 2002)

  10 Mar 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:
  
    Resolved bug #1021; updated /etc/init.d/consolefont for this.

    Resolved bug #1029; updated /etc/init.d/net.eth0 for this.

    Resolved bug #990; updated /etc/init.d/net.eth0, /etc/init.d/netmount
    and /etc/init.d/localmount for this.

    Lots of form/syntax cleanups, most things should be more
    consistant now.  Fixed fail detection/return values of lots of
    scripts.

    Lots of cleanup/fixes in the three main scripts behind our
    rc-system, /sbin/rc, /etc/init.d/depscan.sh, /etc/init.d/runscript.sh

    Fix a bug regarding a invalid $PATH for portage if /etc/init.d/functions.sh
    is sourced in a ebuild.

    Fix a bug that our rc-script wrapper introduced:  Global variables
    in scripts no longer worked.  Updated /etc/init.d/runscript.sh for
    this.

    Implemented more error checking for the main startup code in /sbin/rc.
    Also fixed try() for mounting /proc (maybe all mount commands).
    The function worked fine in a simulated test, but in real life failed
    to detect a error when mounting /proc (remember to thank Grant for
    his UserMode ebuilds, and Guide).

* rc-scripts 1.2.9 (6 Mar 2002)

  6 Mar 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:
  
    General form updates and some piping fixes.

    Updated /etc/inittab, /etc/init.d/xdm and /etc/X11/startDM.sh
    to fix a problem where startDM.sh would be respawned repeatedly
    if xdm was not in the default runlevel.

* rc-scripts 1.2.8 (4 Mar 2002)

  4 Mar 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:
  
    Add /etc/init.d/xdm, /etc/X11/startDM.sh and updated /etc/inittab
    to fix the "dead key" problem we had with xdm/gdm/kdm.  We should
    move them to the xfree ebuild later on when things settles down.

    Added some sanity checks to /sbin/rc, /etc/init.d/runscripts.sh.

    Added a basic $PATH to /etc/init.d/functions.sh to fix a problem
    where we had a invalid $PATH on boot in some cases.

    Updated /etc/init.d/keymap and /etc/init.d/consolefont to work with
    the new sys-apps/kbd package.

* rc-scripts 1.2.7 (3 Mar 2002)

  3 Mar 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:
  
    Fixed the problem of rc-scripts trying to start/stop a service multiple
    times if it fails to do so.  Updated /etc/init.d/runscript.sh and /sbin/rc
    for this.

    Fixing some variable declarations in /etc/init.d/runscript.sh caused
    /etc/init.d/net.lo to fail on stop ($IFACE was set invalid). Fixed
    this.

    Added caching of the "depend() { need foo; } " lines, and updated
    /etc/init.d/depscan.sh to touch the actual files less.  This should
    speedup dependency caching a lot, especially on slow machines.

    Updated /etc/passwd to have users with no shell defined, use /bin/false
    for security.

    Update /etc/fstab to mention /dev/shm since we dont mount it anymore.

  1 Mar 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:
  
    Added a wrapper for sourcing the rc-scripts to eliminate syntax errors.
    Thanks to Karl Trygve Kalleberg (aka karltk) for the idea.  Updated
    /etc/init.d/depscan.sh, /etc/init.d/functions.sh and
    /etc/init.d/runscript.sh for this (added wrap_rcscript() function).

    Removed stopping of dependent services that have current service as
    a 'use'dependency ... should be less confusing now.
    Updated /etc/init.d/runscript.sh for this.

  28 Feb 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:
  
    Add /etc/conf.d/local.start and /etc/conf.d/local.stop for adding any misc
    programs to startup.  This should pretty much have /etc/init.d/ static,
    except for baselayout updates, etc.

  27 Feb 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:
  
    In some wierd cases, a redundent /dev/.devfsd on a unmounted /dev can cause
    problems.  Fixed this in /sbin/rc.

    Added the patches from Grant Goodyear (aka g2boojum) to enable us to
    use a ramdisk to store the contents of ${svcdir}.  Updated /sbin/rc,
    /etc/init.d/functions.sh and /etc/init.d/checkroot for this.

  26 Feb 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:
  
    Fix my brain dead update of the 25th.  It really should keep
    "gentoo=nodevfs" in mind.  Also added 'get_bootparam()' to help in
    retrieving kernel options.  Updated /etc/init.d/functions.sh,
    /etc/init.d/checkroot and /sbin/rc for this.

    Updated /etc/init.d/consolefont to work without devfs as well.

    When rebooting or shutting down, a service should not fail to stop
    if a service it depends on, fails.  Updated /etc/init.d/runscript.sh
    for this.

  25 Feb 2002; Martin Schlemmer <azarah@gentoo.org>:
  
    Added a check if /dev is mounted when creating entries for /etc/mtab.
    This should solve a invalid entry or /dev being mounted even with
    'gentoo=nodevfs' option.  Updated /etc/init.d/checkroot for this.

  17 Feb 2002: Daniel Robbins <drobbins@gentoo.org>: Made "xfs" the default
  filesystem in /etc/fstab (from ReiserFS) and removed "notail" option (it's
  just in a comment now)

  17 Feb 2002: Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org):
  
    Mmore fixes to 'after' and 'before', updated /etc/init.d/runscript.sh for
    this.  This should fix services not getting started in the correct order
    in a tight loop,  services getting stopped out of order, and some other
    sanity checks.  Updated rc-script.sh for updated help.
  
  15 Feb 2002: Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org):
  
    Update /etc/profile to resolve bug #588.  Reimplemented things a bit,
    and added the 'after' type. 'before' and 'after' will only work currently
    for a change of runlevel.  Updated /etc/init.d/depscan.sh,
    /etc/init.d/runscript.sh and /sbin/rc for this.

  13 Feb 2002: Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org):
  
    Add some more entries to /etc/devfsd.conf to make alsa users life
    easier ...  thanks Tod.

  12 Feb 2002: Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org):
  
    Some more cleanups to /etc/init.d/depscan.sh and /etc/init.d/runscript.sh.

    Fixed some services not starting again when restarting a service.
    Seems simple is still the best way.

    Fixed some other problems created with feature additions and cleanups.

  11 Feb 2002: Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org):
  
    General cleanups to /etc/init.d/depscan.sh and /etc/init.d/runscript.sh.

    Added 'before *' to /etc/init.d/checkroot to make sure it gets
    started first.

    Added 'use *' to /etc/init.d/local to make sure it gets started
    last.

  10 Feb 2002: Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org):
  
    Fixed /sbin/rc to stop a service on change of runlevel if it is
    in 'use' by another service.

    Added the 'provide' depend type for creating virtual services.
    Updated /etc/init.d/depscan.sh for this.

    Added the 'before' depend type.  This is more for changing the
    order services start in.  Updated /etc/init.d/depscan.sh and
    /etc/init.d/functions.sh for this.

    Updated /etc/init.d/depscan.sh to work with '*' as argument for
    dependency types.  This can be used with 'use' and 'before' to
    start a script last or first respectively.

    Added save_options() and get_options() to /etc/init.d/functions.sh
    for saving misc settings between startup/shutdown.  Updated
    /etc/init.d/net.eth0 to use these and properly down virtual
    interfaces.

  6 Feb 2002: Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org):
  
    Updated both /etc/init.d/bootmisc and /etc/init.d/keymaps to be quiet
    on no errors.

* rc-scripts 1.2.6 (6 Feb 2002)

  2 Feb 2002: Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org):
  
    Updated /etc/net.eth0 to specify the gateway device via the $gateway
    variable (something like gateway="eth0/192.168.0.1").

  2 Feb 2002: Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org):
  
    Added rc-script /etc/init.d/numlock, for enabling numlock at boot.

  29 Jan 2002: Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org):
  
    Hopefully the last fix to /etc/init.d/netmount to umount cleanly.  This fix
    implements a retry if not successful the first time, and will kill
    processess using the mount.  Also small type-o fix to /etc/init.d/halt.sh.

  27 Jan 2002: Donny Davies (woodchip@gentoo.org): security fix to
  /etc/pam.d/sshd,login,chsh: added pam_shells.so to the stack.
  Fixed /etc/passwd,group for user/group mysql.

  27 Jan 2002: Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org): added charset
  map file support to /etc/init.d/consolefont and the setting to
  /etc/rc.conf.

  25 Jan 2002: Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org): fixed dircolors
  in skel files to support both versions of dircolors.

  23 Jan 2002: Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org): fixed bug
  in the restart stuff of /etc/init.d/runscript.sh that caused
  a restart of a 'net' service not to restart services again
  that depended on it.

* rc-scripts 1.2.5 (20 Jan 2002)

  20 Jan 2002: Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org): updated
  /etc/init.d/net.eth0 to 'use' pcmcia.

  8  Jan 2002: Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org): added '--sh' to
  the dircolors command in /etc/skel/.bash_profile to handle cases
  where bash do not export $SHELL.

  6  Jan 2002: Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org): updated 
  /etc/init.d/runscripts.sh, /etc/init.d/net.eth0, /etc/conf.d/net and
  removed /etc/init.d/net.eth0-dhcp to reflect a new 'bsd-ish' config
  scheme for the net.eth* scripts.

  6  Jan 2002: Donny Davies (woodchip@gentoo.org): Removed email address
  from manpages; no need for that..

  5  Jan 2002: Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org): fix type-o in
  /etc/devfsd.conf; had 'dvd' in the cdrw stuff.

* rc-scripts 1.2.4 (30 Dec 2001)

  30 Dec 2001: Daniel Robbins (drobbins@gentoo.org): Changed default umask
  back to 022 as it should be.

  30 Dec 2001; Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org): Updated
  /etc/init.d/checkfs to return 0 if the fs was successfully repaired.

  29 Dec 2001; Donny Davies (woodchip@gentoo.org):
    sort -t: -k3,3 -n /etc/passwd,group.  Ahhhh :))

  28 Dec 2001; Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org);
  
    Updated /etc/init.d/depscan.sh to store info about missing dependencies
    of type 'need' in ${svcdir}/broken.  Also updated /etc/init.d/runscript.sh
    to use this when starting a script ('need' dependencies is critical for
    startup).  Added the broken() function to /etc/init.d/runscript.sh
    to list the missing dependencies.

    Updated /etc/init.d/runscript.sh for svc_start() to have better error
    checking.

    Updated /etc/init.d/functions.sh with ewend(), which is the same as
    eend(), but print a warning on error, not a error.  Updated
    /etc/init.d/checkroot and /etc/init.d/checkfs to use this function.

  27 Dec 2001; Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org);
  
    Update /sbin/runscript.c to run /etc/init.d/rc-help.sh if no arguments
    is passed to a rc-script.
  
    Added /etc/init.d/rc-help.sh, simple script that prints out help for
    the rc-scripts.

  25 Dec 2001; Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org);
  
    Update /etc/init.d/shutdown.sh and /etc/init.d/reboot.sh not to force the
    halt and reboot.  This fixes a problem where / was not unmounted properly
    in some cases.

  24 Dec 2001; Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org):
  
    Move $svcdir to to /etc/init.d/functions.sh, and update
    /etc/init.d/runscript.sh and /etc/init.d/depscan.sh for this

    Modified /etc/init.d/runscript.sh to also restart the services that
    depend on a service if that service is restarted.  Enhanced the
    restart function to be able to have custom restart() functions in
    rc-scripts.  The custom restart() have to use svc_stop() and
    svc_start() to restart the service.

    Add a pause function to /etc/init.d/runscript.sh.  It will basically
    stop a service without stopping the services that depends on that
    service.

    Add a pause function to /etc/init.d/runscript.sh.  It will basically stop a
    service without stopping the services that depends on that service.

* rc-scripts 1.2.3 (18 Dec 2001)

  16 Dec 2001; Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org):
  
    Moved the stuff from /sbin/init (old) to /sbin/rc (basically drop the
    init wrapper we used).

    Some cleanups:  take out the shm resize comment;

                    remove the $wrongmount;

                    remove the mountshm() function and insert it directly
                    where needed;

                    remove the setting of $PATH as /sbin/init already do 
                    this for us.

    Added the if statement to detect if it is the first time the 'boot'
    runlevel is executed (if [ "$RUNLEVEL" = "S" ] && [ "$argv1" = "boot" ]).
    $RUNLEVEL is a env var set by /sbin/init.

    Also added functionality to detect if the kernel have DEVFS support
    compiled in; seems new users thinks devfs is unstable and as they do
    not always read the docs, it does not get compiled in ;/  Should
    make live for us a bit easier.
    
  14 Dec 2001; Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org):
  
    Fixed /sbin/rc to kill a cosmetic bug in the part that stops all
    the unneeded services.  

* rc-scripts 1.2.2 (8 Dec 2001)

  10 Dec 2001; Added a localhost entry in /etc/hosts.

  8  Dec 2001; Donny Davies (woodchip@gentoo.org): Added start-stop-daemon.c
  to rc-scripts/sbin source.  Moved rc-scripts/init.d/runscript.c to
  rc-scripts/sbin/runscript.c.  Added manpage for start-stop-daemon.
  Start-stop-daemon is moved here from sysvinit by the way.  There is stuff
  in this ChangeLog that needs to be removed! Like the changes to hosts,
  profile.  /etc/{passwd,group} have minor UID and GID type fixes for
  users ftp, postgres, xfs.  Tweaked tarball.sh to not include CVS
  directories.

  29 Nov 2001; Donny Davies (woodchip@gentoo.org): Added a man directory
  to rc-scripts.  Checked in two manpages there, one for modules.autoload.5
  and one for update-modules.8. These were adapted from Debian. Updated
  tarball.sh to include the new man directory. Updated baselayout to install
  these manpages. Slightly tweak the /etc/modules.autoload comments.

  28 Nov 2001; Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org):
  
    Updated /sbin/init to work correctly with the 'gentoo=nodevfs' option,
    and cleaned out old code.

    Updated /etc/init.d/bootmisc with additional lock files to clean.

  27 Nov 2001; Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org):
  
    Updated /etc/init.d/depscan.sh for a virtual 'use' depend, called 'logger'
    that can be used for services that needs to have a logger started before
    they are started.  Updated /etc/conf.d/basic with $SYSLOGGER that is used
    to define what loggers the 'logger' depend represent.

  26 Nov 2001; Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org):
  
    Updated /etc/passwd and /etc/group with minor fixes to pass pwck
    and grpck.

  25 Nov 2001; Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org):
  
    Changed umask in /etc/profile for the user to 077 for security.

    Added a stop() function to /etc/init.d/clock.  Also removed uneeded
    'source /etc/rc.conf' line.

    Updated /etc/init.d/hostname to set the hostname to 'localhost' if
    /etc/hostname is invalid.

    Updated /sbin/init to move the entries in /lib/dev-state to /dev before
    running devfsd, as it did still not save settings properly.  Also removed
    old /dev-state/compat stuff.

  25 Nov 2001; ncsd, the name service cache daemon script, has been removed
  from the default "default" runlevel.  It still exists in the archive so that
  users who want/need it can add it easily.

  25 Nov 2001; Updated the /etc/fstab; removed usbdevfs (explicitly mounted),
  removed notail from the ext2 boot partition, other cleanups.

  25 Nov 2001; Fixed init.d/clock script to work in UTC mode.

  24 Nov 2001; Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org):
  
    Added /etc/devfsd.conf and updated /sbin/init to use a new scheme for saving
    /dev permissions.  Also moved /dev-state to /lib/dev-state which is a more
    standard location.

    Fixed a ugly bug in /etc/init.d/depscan.sh.  If a service depended on
    itself, calling depscan.sh or changing runlevels cause a tempory effect
    similar to a 'mini fork bomb'.  Afterwards the depends was broken, and
    changing runlevels did not want to work.

    Updated /etc/init.d/halt.sh to terminate and display message for devfsd.
    More cosmetic than anything else, but cant hurt with the new dev-state
    scheme.

    Updated /sbin/init to set the console log level to 1, so that bootup
    can be much cleaner.  Also updated /etc/init.d/modules not to have
    a logger in it 'use' depends, as it should not be needed anymore.

    Updated /sbin/rc to check if devfsd is still running between runlevel
    changes.

    Updated /etc/init.d/modules to run update-modules.  We want to be sure
    /etc/modules.conf is updated when running depmod -a.

    Change ftp's uid to 21 in /etc/passwd (was the same as bind).  Also
    added a entry for xfs (X Font Server) in /etc/passwd and /etc/group.

    Added /etc/init.d/net.ppp0, /etc/conf.d/net.ppp0 and
    /usr/lib/ppp/chat-default as part of my new pppd scripts.  Also
    updated tarball.sh to handle ppp/chat-default.

    Added /etc/skel/.bash* to make things cleaner.

    Other minor changes.

  17 Nov 2001; Donny Davies (woodchip@gentoo.org): Added /etc/shells file
  to rc-scripts.  Can remove it from sys-libs/shadow at the next release.

* rc-scripts 1.1.8 (15 Nov 2001)

  16 Nov 2001; removed bogus "mountall.test" script.
  
  15 Nov 2001; Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org):
  
    Updated init.d/{runscript.sh,depscan.sh}, sbin/rc to the new dep being
    'use' not 'uses', as it fits better with 'need' (not 'needs').  Also
    removed unneeded for loop from init.d/depscan.sh, and other fixes.  Updated
    names of new functions in init.d/runscript.sh to better sounding ones.
    Updated init.d/modules, init.d/netmount to use 'use'.  Lots of other
    fixes/cleanups.
    
    Removed try() out of init.d/runscript.sh (why was this here ?).

  14 Nov 2001; Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org): 
  
    Now init.d/bootmisc cleans /tmp.  Also creates /etc/resolv.conf if it
    doesn't exist.

    init.d/hostname:  Added check for a valid /etc/hostname.

    init.d/keymaps:  Added check for valid $KEYMAP.

    init.d/modules:  Added sysklogd, metalog, syslog-ng as 'use' deps.  This
    should solve Woodchip's syslog+glue issue.  We just have to change the
    console loglevel for metalog and syslog-ng (sysklogd already updated) not to
    output info and warnings, etc to the console, then boot will be much cleaner.
    Also the install guide will need changing to add the loggers to 'boot' and
    not 'default' runlevel.

    init.d/mountall.test:  Hopefully updated to the new rc-scripts style.  Is
    this really needed (I cannot see that it is used anywhere ...)?

  13 Nov 2001; Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org):
  
    Updated init.d/runscript.sh, init.d/depscan.sh and sbin/rc with a new depend
    called 'uses'.  It basically have the same usage as 'need', except that it
    do not start services that is not in the current and 'boot' runlevels.

    Updated init.d/netmount to use the 'uses' depend.

  11 Nov 2001; Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org):
  
    Fixed init.d/runscript.sh not to destroy the 'need' depends in
    /${svcdir}/need.  This caused subsequent starting and stopping of services
    not to start depends.

  7 Nov 2001; Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org):
  
    Fixed a problem in sbin/rc where the ${svcdir}/softscripts directory got
    destroyed before stopping running services scheduled to be stopped.  This
    with the fact that $SOFTLEVEL was set too early, caused the services to be
    stopped in the wrong order.

  30 Oct 2001; Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org):
  
    Modified init.d/netmount to check if any network filesystems is mounted.

  29 Oct 2001; init.d/netmount: umount -art doesn't seem to work, so I added
  some awk and grep magic to find all remote filesystems and umount them.
  
  29 Oct 2001; Martin Schlemmer (azarah@gentoo.org):
  
    A fix for checkroot (missing "/"); it now actually checks the root
    filesystem.  Also, a localmount cleanliness fix.
