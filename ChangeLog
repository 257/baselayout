  05 Apr 2007; Roy Marples <uberlord@gentoo.org>:

    Rewrite the core parts in C. We now provide librc so other programs can
    query runlevels, services and state without using bash. We also provide
    libeinfo so other programs can easily use our informational functions.
    
    As such, we have dropped the requirement of using bash as the init script
    shell. We now use /bin/sh and have strived to make the scripts as portable
    as possible. Shells that work are bash and dash. busybox works provided
    you disable s-s-d. If you have WIPE_TMP set to yes in conf.d/bootmisc you
    should disable find too.
    zsh and ksh do not work at this time.

    Networking support is currently being re-vamped also as it was heavily bash
    array based. As such, a new config format is available like so
    config_eth0="1.2.3.4/24 5.6.7.8/16"
    or like so
    config_eth0="'1.2.3.4 netmask 255.255.255.0' '5.6.7.8 netmask 255.255.0.0'"

    We will still support the old bash array format provided that /bin/sh IS
    a link it bash.

    ChangeLog for baselayout-1 can be found in our SVN repo.
