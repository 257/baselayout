# /etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.6:  kernel modules to load when system boots.
#
# Note that this file is for 2.6 kernels.
#
# WARNING: It is dangerous to put modules here which will cause hotplug to
# start services, for example network driver modules.
# For network modules it is advisable to use coldplug to load your modules.
# You can do this by emerging coldplug and adding coldplug do the boot runlevel
# using rc-update. See bug #118419 for why this is.

# Add the names of modules that you'd like to load when the system
# starts into this file, one per line.  Comments begin with # and
# are ignored.  Read man modules.autoload for additional details.

# For example:
# aic7xxx
