# /etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.4:  kernel modules to load when system boots.
#
# Note that this file is for 2.4 kernels.  If you need different modules
# for a 2.6 kernel, you can create /etc/modules.autoload.d/kernel-2.6
#
# This file should only be used to load modules that are essential to the
# mounting of local partitions, such as RAID controllers.
# Coldplug or similar should be used to load the rest of the modules
# for your hardware automatically.
#
# WARNING: It is dangerous to put modules here which will cause hotplug to
# start services, for example network driver modules.

# Add the names of modules that you'd like to load when the system
# starts into this file, one per line.  Comments begin with # and
# are ignored.  Read man modules.autoload for additional details.

# For example:
# aic7xxx
