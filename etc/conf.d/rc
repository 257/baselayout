# Set to "yes" if you want the rc system to try and start services
# in parallel for a slight speed improvement.

RC_PARALLEL_STARTUP="no"

# Set to "yes" if you require a net.* service running (other than 
# just net.lo) to satisfy the generic 'net' dependency

RC_NET_STRICT_CHECKING="no"

# Use this variable to control the /dev management behavior.
#  auto   - let the scripts figure out what's best at boot
#  devfs  - use devfs (requires sys-fs/devfsd)
#  udev   - use udev (requires sys-fs/udev)
#  static - let the user manage static nodes

RC_DEVICES="auto"

# UDEV OPTION:
# Set to "yes" if you want to save /dev to a tarball on shutdown
# and restore it on startup.  This is useful if you have a lot of
# custom device nodes that udev does not handle/know about.

RC_DEVICE_TARBALL="yes"

# UDEV OPTION:
# FS type that should be used for /dev.  Currently just tmpfs and 
# ramfs are supported.  The downside of tmpfs is that you have to 
# enable support for it in the kernel.  The downside of ramfs is 
# that it has no size restrictions.

# Controlling start-stop-daemon behavior
#
# NOTE: most of these are not in use yet!!

# Set to "yes" if stop-daemon() should always retry killing the

# Set the amount of seconds stop-daemon() should wait between
# retries.  $RC_RETRY_KILL should be set to "yes".

RC_RETRY_TIMEOUT=1


# Set the amount of times stop-daemon() should try to kill
# a service before giving up.  $RC_RETRY_KILL should be set to "yes".

# Set to "yes" if stop-daemon() should fail if the service
# is marked as started, but not actually running on stop.
