This is the rc-scripts style manual.  It governs the 
coding style of rc-scripts.  Everything here might as 
well have been spoken by God.  If you find any issues,

# VARIABLES #
#############
- User Variables -
    Variables must always be enclosed by {}
      e.g. ${foo} ${bar}
- Internal Bash Variables -
    Do not use {} with internal variables
      e.g. $@ $1 $IFS

#########
# TESTS #
#########
- Brackets -
    Always use the [[ ... ]] form instead of [ ... ]
- Quoting -
    When dealing with strings, do not quote the variable
    The [[ ... ]] handles spaces properly in variables
      e.g. [[ ${foo} = "bar" ]]

###############
# CODE BLOCKS #
###############
- Loops -
    Use the more compact form
      e.g. if ... ; then
      e.g. while ... ; do
    Do not use the older form
      e.g. if ...
           then
- Functions -
    Use the more compact form
      e.g. foo() {
    Do not lead with 'function '
      e.g. function foo() {

############
# COMMENTS #
############
- General -
    Try to include a comment block before sections 
    of code to explain what you're attempting
