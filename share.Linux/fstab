# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# noatime turns off atimes for increased performance (atimes normally aren't 
# needed); notail increases performance of ReiserFS (at the expense of storage 
# efficiency).  It's safe to drop the noatime options if you want and to 
# switch between notail / tail freely.
#
# The root filesystem should have a pass number of either 0 or 1.
# All other filesystems should have a pass number of 0 or greater than 1.
#
# See the manpage fstab(5) for more information.
#

# <fs>			<mountpoint>	<type>		<opts>		<dump/pass>

# NOTE: If your BOOT partition is ReiserFS, add the notail option to opts.
#
# NOTE: Even though we list ext4 as the type here, it will work with ext2/ext3
#       filesystems.  This just tells the kernel to use the ext4 driver.
#
# NOTE: You can use full paths to devices like /dev/sda3, but nowadays it is
#       recommended to set labels in the filesystem and mount via that.  All
#       modern Linux filesystems should support this functionality.  If your
#       boot partition is /dev/sda1 and is ext4, you can set the label of it
#       to "boot" by running:
#         # e2label /dev/sda1 boot
#       Then the LABEL example below will work for you.
#LABEL=boot		/boot		ext4		noauto,noatime	1 2
#LABEL=root		/		ext4		noatime		0 1
#LABEL=swap		none		swap		sw		0 0
#/dev/cdrom		/mnt/cdrom	auto		noauto,ro	0 0
