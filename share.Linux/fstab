# /etc/fstab: static file system information.

# noatime turns off atimes for increased performance (atimes normally aren't 
# needed; notail increases performance of ReiserFS (at the expense of storage 
# efficiency).  It's safe to drop the noatime options if you want and to 
# switch between notail / tail freely.
#
# The root filesystem should have a pass number of either 0 or 1.
# All other filesystems should have a pass number of 0 or greater than 1.
#
# See the manpage fstab(5) for more information.
#
# Keep in mind that the boot scripts will ignore many of the core mounts
# (like /proc or /dev or /dev/shm) unless you set RC_USE_FSTAB in your
# /etc/conf.d/rc file appropriately.

# NOTE: If your BOOT partition is ReiserFS, add the notail option to opts.
