# Kernel core dump options for FreeBSD kernel.
# Unless you're a FreeBSD kernel developer or driver writer then this won't
# be of any interest to you at all.

# The following options allow to configure the kernel's core dump
# facilities. Please read
# http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/developers-handbook/kerneldebug.html
# for more information about Kernel core dumps and kernel debugging.

# KERNEL_DUMP_DEVICE variable is used to specify which device will be
# used by the kernel to write the dump down. This has to be a swap
# partition, and has to be at least big enough to contain the whole
# physical memory (see hw.physmem sysctl(8) variable).
# When the variable is commented out, no core dump will be enabled for
# the kernel.
#KERNEL_DUMP_DEVICE="/dev/ad0s1b"

# KERNEL_DUMP_DIR variable is used to tell savecore(8) utility where
# to save the kernel core dump once it's restored from the dump
# device. If unset, /var/crash will be used, as the default of
# FreeBSD.
#KERNEL_DUMP_DIR="/var/crash"

# KERNEL_DUMP_COMPRESS variable decide whether to compress with
# gzip(1) the dump or leave it of its original size (the size of the
# physical memory present on the system). If set to yes, the -z option
# will be passed to savecore(8) that will proceed on compressing the
# dump.
#KERNEL_DUMP_COMPRESS="no"
