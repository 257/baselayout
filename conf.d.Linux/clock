CLOCK_OPTS=""

# Newer FHS specs say this file should live in /var/lib rather than
# /etc.  If you care about such things, feel free to change this value.
# Note that a blank value means that you do not wish to even use the
# adjtime facility.  This is the default behavior as adjtime can be
# very fragile.  If the clock is updated without updating the adjtime
# file (which is common when using services such as ntp), then the
# clock can be screwed up when it gets updated at next boot.

#CLOCK_ADJTIME="/var/lib/adjtime"
#CLOCK_ADJTIME="/etc/adjtime"
