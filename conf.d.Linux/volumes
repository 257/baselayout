# IMPORTANT
# volumes dependancy order is specified here so users can move it before
# checkroot so that it can create the needed nodes in /dev.
# By default it comes after modules in case the volume required modules
# are not compiled into the kernel.

RC_NEED="checkroot"
RC_USE="modules"

# VOLUME_ORDER allows you to specify, or even remove the volume setup
# for various volume managers (MD, EVMS2, LVM, DM, etc).  Note that they are
# stopped in reverse order.
