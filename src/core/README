* Introduction
==============

This is still fairly alpha code, although I have tried to regression test it
fairly extensively.  After many requests, I have added it to CVS, so please
do understand that it still is work in progress, although it should duplicate
depscan.sh in functionality.

To all those that might dabble with this, please send comments or fixes my
way, and if I can ask very nicely, please do not commit before checking with
me first, as I do have some large changes and additions still in the pipeline.
