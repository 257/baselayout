nss_service is a nss plugin for glibc that checks to see if the configured
service has started yet. This is handy when nss uses either ldap or nis.
In these cases we want the network service(s) to have started (if we're a
client) or the ldap / nis service to have started (if we're a server).

I primarily wrote this to solve Gentoo bug #99564 where udev tries to find a
user who is no longer provided by baselayout but is provided by an ebuild.
Normally this isn't a problem, but if you're using ldap then it's not available
at boot time which causes a big big problem. Hence, nss_service to the rescue.
