# QUICK-START
#
# The quickest start is if you want to use DHCP.  In that case,
# everything should work out of the box, no configuration necessary,
# though the startup script will warn you that you haven't specified
# anything.
#
# If you want to use a static address or use DHCP explicitly, jump
# down to the section labelled IFCONFIG.
#
# If you want to do anything more fancy, you should take the time to
# read through the rest of this file.


##############################################################################
# MODULES
#
# We now support modular networking scripts which means we can easily
# add support for new interface types and modules while keeping
# compatability with existing ones.
# 
# Modules load by default if the package they need is installed.  If
# you specify a module here that doesn't have it's package installed
# then you get an error stating which package you need to install.
# Ideally, you only use the modules setting when you have two or more
# packages installed that supply the same service.
#
# In other words, you probably should DO NOTHING HERE...

# Prefer iproute2 over ifconfig
#modules=( "iproute2" )

# You can also specify other modules for an interface
# In this case we prefer pump over dhcpcd
#modules_eth0=( "pump" )


##############################################################################
# INTERFACE HANDLERS
# 
# We provide two interface handlers presently: ifconfig and iproute2.
# You need one of these to do any kind of network configuration.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# IFCONFIG
# For ifconfig support, emerge sys-apps/net-tools

# For a static configuration, use something like this
#ifconfig_eth0=(
#	"192.168.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0"
#)

# If you need aliases, use something like this instead.  This sets the
# primary eth0 address to 192.168.0.2 and adds two aliases, eth0:1 and
# eth0:2
#ifconfig_eth0=(
#	"192.168.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0"
#	"192.168.0.3 netmask 255.255.255.0"
#	"192.168.0.4 netmask 255.255.255.0"
#)

# This is just like setting the gateway config option in the old-style iface
# config, but allows one to add custom routes.  This should not be needed if
# you are obtaining an address via DHCP since the default route should be set
# automatically.
#routes_eth0=(
#	"default gw 192.168.0.1"
#)

# If a specified module fails (like dhcp - see below), you can specify a fallback like so
#ifconfig_fallback_eth0=( "192.168.0.2/24 netmask 255.255.255.0" )


#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# IPROUTE2
# For iproute2 support, emerge sys-apps/iproute2 and add "iproute2" to the
# modules array above like so
#modules=( "iproute2" )

# For a static configuration, use something like this
#ipaddr_eth0=(
#	"192.168.0.2/24"
#)

# If you need aliases, use something like this instead.  This sets the
# primary eth0 address to 192.168.0.2 and adds two aliases, eth0:1 and
# eth0:2
#ipaddr_eth0=(
#	"192.168.0.2/24"
#	"192.168.0.3/24"
#	"192.168.0.4/24"
#)

# The following will set up the default gateway. You can also pass advanced
# route configs via this option.
#iproute_eth0=(
#	"default via 192.168.0.1"
#)

# If a specified module fails (like dhcp - see below), you can specify a fallback like so
#ipaddr_fallback_eth0=( "192.168.0.2" )

# OPTIONAL MODULES

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WIRELESS (802.11 support)
# For wireless support, emerge net-wireless/wireless-tools
#
# Wireless options are held in /etc/conf.d/wireless - but could be here too
# The wireless setting are generally not configured for a specific interface
# as they are more geared towards specific ESSID's
#
# When an interface has been associated with an Access Point, a global
# variable called ESSID is set to the Access Point's ESSID for use in the
# pre/post user functions below - although it's probably only really
# usefull in the postup() function

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DHCP
# DHCP can be provided by dhcpcd (default), dhclient, udhcpc or pump
#
# dhcpcd:   emerge net-misc/dhcpcd
# dhclient: emerge net-misc/dhcp   and modules=( "dhclient" ) above
# udhcp:    emerge net-misc/udhcp  and modules=( "udhcp" ) above
# pump:     emerge net-misc/pump   and modules=( "pump" ) above
#
# Notes:
# - all clients except for dhclient send the current hostname to the DHCP
#   server by default
# - pump does not support NIS

# Regardless of which DHCP client you prefer, you configure them the
# same way using one of following depending on which interface modules
# you're using.
#ifconfig_eth0=( "dhcp" )	# for ifconfig
#ipaddr_eth0=( "dhcp" )		# for iproute2

# For passing custom options to dhcpcd use something like the following.  This
# example reduces the timeout for retrieving an address from 60 seconds (the
# default) to 10 seconds.
#dhcpcd_eth0="-t 10"

# dhclient, udhcpc and pump don't have many runtime options
# You can pass options to them in a similar manner to dhcpcd though
#dhclient_eth0="..."
#udhcpc_eth0="..."
#pump_eth0="..."

# To set options for dhclient, you need to have an /etc/dhclient.conf file
# See the dhclient man page for details

# GENERIC DHCP OPTIONS
# These can be set globally (setting=...) or per interface (setting_eth0=...)

# To stop DHCP from overwritting DNS (/etc/resolv.conf) use the below settings
# peer_dns="no"
# peer_dns_eth0="no"

# To stop DHCP from overwritting NIS (/etc/yp.conf) use the below settings
# peer_nis="no"
# peer_nis_eth0="no"

# To stop DHCP from overwritting NTP /etc/ntp.conf use the below settings
# peer_ntp="no"
# peer_ntp_eth0="no"

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# VLAN (802.1q support)
# For VLAN support, emerge net-misc/vconfig

# Specify the VLAN numbers for the interface like so
# Please ensure your VLAN IDs are NOT zero-padded
#vlans_eth0="1 2"

# Then setup the interface for each VLAN using either iproute2 or ifconfig like
# so
#ifconfig_eth0_1=( "dhcp" )
#ifconfig_eth0_2=( "172.16.2.1 netmask 255.255.254.0" )
# This configures eth0_1 to use DHCP and eth0_2 for a static address

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bonding (802.1q support)
# For link bonding/trunking emerge net-misc/ifenslave

# if you are using any of the slave interfaces, it is important that you remove
# configurations for them and take them down first!
#slaves_bond0="eth2"
#ipaddr_bond0=( "172.16.2.1/23 brd 172.16.3.255" )

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ADSL
# For ADSL support, emerge net-dialup/rp-pppoe 
# You should make the following settings and also put your
# username/password information in /etc/ppp/pap-secrets

# Configure the interface to use ADSL with one of the following lines,
# depending on whether you're using ifconfig (default) or iproute2.
#ifconfig_eth0=( "adsl" )
#ipaddr_eth0=( "adsl" )

# You probably won't need to edit /etc/ppp/pppoe.conf if you set this
#user_eth0="my-adsl-username"

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# MAC changer
# For changing MAC addresses emerge net-analyzer/macchanger

# - to set a specific MAC address
#mac_eth0="00:11:22:33:44:55"
# - to randomize the last 3 bytes only
#mac_eth0="random-ending"
# - to randomize between the same physical type of connection (eg fibre,
# copper, wireless) , all vendors
#mac_eth0="random-samekind"
# - to randomize between any physical type of connection (eg fibre, copper,
# wireless) , all vendors
#mac_eth0="random-anykind"
# - full randomization - WARNING: some MAC addresses generated by this may NOT
# act as expected
#mac_eth0="random-full"
# custom - passes all parameters directly to net-analyzer/macchanger
#mac_eth0="some custom set of parameters"


##############################################################################
# ADVANCED CONFIGURATION
# 
# Four functions can be defined which will be called surrounding the
# start/stop operations.  The functions are called with the interface
# name first so that one function can control multiple adapters.
#
# The return values for the preup and predown functions should be 0
# (success) to indicate that configuration or deconfiguration of the
# interface can continue.  If preup returns a non-zero value, then
# interface configuration will be aborted.  If predown returns a
# non-zero value, then the interface will not be allowed to continue
# deconfiguration.
#
# The return values for the postup and postdown functions are ignored
# since there's nothing to do if they indicate failure.

#preup() {
#	# This function could be used, for example, to configure a
#	# wireless interface for Cisco LEAP authentication.
#
#	# Test for link on the interface prior to bringing it up.  This
#	# only works on some network adapters and requires the ethtool
#	# package to be installed.
#	if ethtool $1 | grep -q 'Link detected: no'; then
#		ewarn "No link on $1, aborting configuration"
#		return 1
#	fi
#
#	# Remember to return 0 on success
#	return 0
#}

#predown() {
#	# The default in the script is to test for NFS root and disallow
#	# downing interfaces in that case.  Note that if you specify a
#	# predown() function you will override that logic.  Here it is, in
#	# case you still want it...
#	if is_net_fs /; then
#		eerror "root filesystem is network mounted -- can't stop ${IFACE}"
#		return 1
#	fi
#
#	# Remember to return 0 on success
#	return 0
#}

#postup() {
#	# This function could be used, for example, to register with a
#	# dynamic DNS service.  Another possibility would be to
#	# send/receive mail once the interface is brought up.
#	return 0
#}

#postdown() {
#	# This function is mostly here for completeness... I haven't
#	# thought of anything nifty to do with it yet ;-)
#	# Return 0 always
#	return 0
#}
