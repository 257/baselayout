# QUICK-START
#
# The quickest start is if you want to use DHCP.
# In that case, everything should work out of the box, no configuration
# necessary, though the startup script will warn you that you haven't
# specified anything.
#
# If you want to use a static address or use DHCP explicitly, jump
# down to the section labelled IFCONFIG.
#
# If you want to do anything more fancy, you should take the time to
# read through the rest of this file.


##############################################################################
# MODULES
#
# We now support modular networking scripts which means we can easily
# add support for new interface types and modules while keeping
# compatability with existing ones.
# 
# Modules load by default if the package they need is installed.  If
# you specify a module here that doesn't have it's package installed
# then you get an error stating which package you need to install.
# Ideally, you only use the modules setting when you have two or more
# packages installed that supply the same service.
#
# In other words, you probably should DO NOTHING HERE...

# Prefer iproute2 over ifconfig
#modules=( "iproute2" )

# You can also specify other modules for an interface
# In this case we prefer pump over dhcpcd
#modules_eth0=( "pump" )

# You can also specify which modules not to use - for example you may be
# using a supplicant which controls wireless configuration but you still
# want to configure network settings per ESSID associated with.
#modules=( "!iwconfig" )


##############################################################################
# INTERFACE HANDLERS
# 
# We provide two interface handlers presently: ifconfig and iproute2.
# You need one of these to do any kind of network configuration.

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# IFCONFIG
# For ifconfig support, emerge sys-apps/net-tools

# For a static configuration, use something like this
#ifconfig_eth0=(
#	"192.168.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0"
#)

# If you need aliases, use something like this instead.  This sets the
# primary eth0 address to 192.168.0.2 and adds two aliases, eth0:1 and
# eth0:2
#ifconfig_eth0=(
#	"192.168.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0"
#	"192.168.0.3 netmask 255.255.255.0"
#	"192.168.0.4 netmask 255.255.255.0"
#)

# To add IPv6 addresses to an interface (cannot add to an aliased interface)
# These addresses are bogus - use your own
#inet6_eth0=( "4321:0:1:2:3:4:567:89ab" "4321:0:1:2:3:4:567:89ac" )

# If you don't want an inet address on your interface (ie only inet6) then
# supply null as the ifconfig parameter
#ifconfig_eth0=( "null" )

# This is just like setting the gateway config option in the old-style iface
# config, but allows one to add custom routes.  This should not be needed if
# you are obtaining an address via DHCP since the default route should be set
# automatically.
#routes_eth0=(
#	"default gw 192.168.0.1"
#)

# If a specified module fails (like dhcp - see below), you can specify a fallback like so
#ifconfig_fallback_eth0=( "192.168.0.2 netmask 255.255.255.0" )
# NOTE: fallback entry must match the entry in ifconfig_eth0


#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# IPROUTE2
# For iproute2 support, emerge sys-apps/iproute2 and add "iproute2" to the
# modules array above like so
#modules=( "iproute2" )

# For a static configuration, use something like this
#ipaddr_eth0=(
#	"192.168.0.2/24"
#)

# If you need aliases, use something like this instead.  This sets the
# primary eth0 address to 192.168.0.2 and adds two aliases, eth0:1 and
# eth0:2
#ipaddr_eth0=(
#	"192.168.0.2/24"
#	"192.168.0.3/24"
#	"192.168.0.4/24"
#)
# NOTE: inet6 addresses do not create an aliases

# To add IPv6 addresses to an interface (cannot add to an aliased interface)
# These addresses are bogus - use your own
#inet6_eth0=( "4321:0:1:2:3:4:567:89ab" "4321:0:1:2:3:4:567:89ac" )

# If you don't want an inet address on your interface (ie only inet6) then
# supply null as the ipaddr parameter
#ipaddr_eth0=( "null" )

# The following will set up the default gateway. You can also pass advanced
# route configs via this option.
#iproute_eth0=(
#	"default via 192.168.0.1"
#)

# If a specified module fails (like dhcp - see below), you can specify a fallback like so
#ipaddr_fallback_eth0=( "192.168.0.2/24" )
# NOTE: fallback entry must match the entry in ifconfig_eth0

# OPTIONAL MODULES

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WIRELESS (802.11 support)
# For wireless support, emerge net-wireless/wireless-tools
#
# Wireless options are held in /etc/conf.d/wireless - but could be here too
# The wireless setting are generally not configured for a specific interface
# as they are more geared towards specific ESSID's
#
# When an interface has been associated with an Access Point, a global
# variable called ESSID is set to the Access Point's ESSID for use in the
# pre/post user functions below - although it's probably only really
# usefull in the postup() function
#
# If you're using a supplicant or daemon to control wireless configuration
# then you need to disable the iwconfig module like so
#modules=( "!iwconfig" )

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DHCP
# DHCP can be provided by dhcpcd, dhclient, udhcpc or pump
#
# dhcpcd:   emerge net-misc/dhcpcd
# dhclient: emerge net-misc/dhcp
# udhcpc:   emerge net-misc/udhcp
# pump:     emerge net-misc/pump

# If you have more than one DHCP client installed, you need to specify which
# one to use - otherwise we default to dhcpcd if available
#modules=( "pump" ) # to select pump over dhcpcd
#
# Notes:
# - dhcpcd, udhcpc and pump send the current hostname
#   to the DHCP server by default
# - pump does not support NIS
# - dhcpcd does not daemonize when the lease time is infinite

# Regardless of which DHCP client you prefer, you configure them the
# same way using one of following depending on which interface modules
# you're using.
#ifconfig_eth0=( "dhcp" )	# for ifconfig
#ipaddr_eth0=( "dhcp" )		# for iproute2

# For passing custom options to dhcpcd use something like the following.  This
# example reduces the timeout for retrieving an address from 60 seconds (the
# default) to 10 seconds.
#dhcpcd_eth0="-t 10"

# dhclient, udhcpc and pump don't have many runtime options
# You can pass options to them in a similar manner to dhcpcd though
#dhclient_eth0="..."
#udhcpc_eth0="..."
#pump_eth0="..."

# To set options for dhclient, you need to have an /etc/dhclient.conf file
# See the dhclient man page for details

# GENERIC DHCP OPTIONS
# These can be set globally (setting=...) or per interface (setting_eth0=...)

# To stop DHCP from overwritting DNS (/etc/resolv.conf) use the below settings
# peer_dns="no"
# peer_dns_eth0="no"

# To stop DHCP from overwritting NIS (/etc/yp.conf) use the below settings
# peer_nis="no"
# peer_nis_eth0="no"

# To stop DHCP from overwritting NTP /etc/ntp.conf use the below settings
# peer_ntp="no"
# peer_ntp_eth0="no"

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)
# For APIPA support, emerge net-misc/iputils or net-analyzer/arping

# APIPA is a module that tries to find a free address in the range
# 169.254.0.0-169.254.255.255 by arping a random address in that range on the
# interface. If no reply is found then we assign that address to the interface

# This is only useful for LANs where there is no DHCP server and you don't
# connect directly to the internet.
#ifconfig_eth0=( "dhcp" )
#ifconfig_fallback_eth0=( "apipa" )

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# VLAN (802.1q support)
# For VLAN support, emerge net-misc/vconfig

# Specify the VLAN numbers for the interface like so
# Please ensure your VLAN IDs are NOT zero-padded
#vlans_eth0="1 2"

# Then setup the interface for each VLAN using either iproute2 or ifconfig like
# so
#ifconfig_eth0_1=( "dhcp" )
#ifconfig_eth0_2=( "172.16.2.1 netmask 255.255.254.0" )
# This configures eth0_1 to use DHCP and eth0_2 for a static address

# You can also configure the vlan - see for vconfig man page for more details
#vlans_eth0="1 2"
#vconfig_eth0=( "set_name_type VLAN_PLUS_VID_NO_PAD" )
#ifconfig_vlan1=( "dhcp" )

#ifconfig_vlan2=( "172.16.2.1 netmask 255.255.254.0" )

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bonding
# For link bonding/trunking emerge net-misc/ifenslave

# If you are using any of the slave interfaces, it is important that you remove
# configurations for them and take them down first!
#slaves_bond0="eth2"
#ipaddr_bond0=( "172.16.2.1/23 brd 172.16.3.255" )

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ADSL
# For ADSL support, emerge net-dialup/rp-pppoe 
# You should make the following settings and also put your
# username/password information in /etc/ppp/pap-secrets

# Configure the interface to use ADSL with one of the following lines,
# depending on whether you're using ifconfig (default) or iproute2.
#ifconfig_eth0=( "adsl" )
#ipaddr_eth0=( "adsl" )

# You probably won't need to edit /etc/ppp/pppoe.conf if you set this
#adsl_user_eth0="my-adsl-username"

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ISDN
# For ISDN support, emerge net-dialup/isdn4k-utils
# You should make the following settings and also put your
# username/password information in /etc/ppp/pap-secrets

# Configure the interface to use ISDN with one of the following lines,
# depending on whether you're using ifconfig (default) or iproute2.
#ifconfig_ippp0=( "dhcp" )
# It's important to specify dhcp if you need it!
#ipaddr_ippp0=( "192.168.0.1/24" )
# Otherwise, you can use a static IP

# NOTE: The interface name must be either ippp or isdn followed by a number

# You may need this option to set the default route
#ipppd_eth0="defaultroute"

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# MAC changer
# For changing MAC addresses emerge net-analyzer/macchanger

# - to set a specific MAC address
#mac_eth0="00:11:22:33:44:55"
# - to randomize the last 3 bytes only
#mac_eth0="random-ending"
# - to randomize between the same physical type of connection (eg fibre,
# copper, wireless) , all vendors
#mac_eth0="random-samekind"
# - to randomize between any physical type of connection (eg fibre, copper,
# wireless) , all vendors
#mac_eth0="random-anykind"
# - full randomization - WARNING: some MAC addresses generated by this may NOT
# act as expected
#mac_eth0="random-full"
# custom - passes all parameters directly to net-analyzer/macchanger
#mac_eth0="some custom set of parameters"

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# TUN/TAP
# For TUN/TAP support emerge sys-apps/usermode-utilities
#
# The below two examples create an interface called tap0
# ifconfig assigns it's address via dhcp
# iproute2 assigns it's address manually
#ifconfig_tap0=( "dhcp" )		# for ifconfig
#ipaddr_tap0=( "192.168.0.1/24")	# for iproute2

# NOTE: The interface name must be either tun or tap followed by a number

# For passing custom options to tunctl use something like the following.  This
# example sets the owner to adm
#tunctl_tap0="-u adm"

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Bridging (802.1d)
# For bridging support emerge net-misc/bridge-utils

# To add ports to bridge br0
#bridge_br0="eth0 eth1"

# You NEED to configure the interface as well
#ifconfig_br0=( "null" ) # This is needed so that dhcp is not started!
#ifconfig_br0=( "dhcp" )
#ifconfig_br0=( "192.168.0.1 netmask 255.255.255.0" )

# NOTE: This creates an interface called br0 - you can give the interface
# any name you like

# Below is an example of configuring the bridge
# Consult "man brctl" for more details
#brctl_br0=( "setfd 0" "sethello 0" "stp off" )

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Tunnelling
# For GRE tunnels
#iptunnel_vpn0="mode gre remote 207.170.82.1 key 0xffffffff ttl 255"

# For IPIP tunnels
#iptunnel_vpn0="mode ipip remote 207.170.82.2 ttl 255"

# To configure the interface via ifconfig
#ifconfig_vpn0=( "192.168.0.2 pointopoint 192.168.1.2" )

# To configure the interface via iproute2
#ipaddr_vpn0=( "192.168.0.2 peer 192.168.1.1" )

# ADVANCED CONFIGURATION
# 
# Four functions can be defined which will be called surrounding the
# start/stop operations.  The functions are called with the interface
# name first so that one function can control multiple adapters.
#
# The return values for the preup and predown functions should be 0
# (success) to indicate that configuration or deconfiguration of the
# interface can continue.  If preup returns a non-zero value, then
# interface configuration will be aborted.  If predown returns a
# non-zero value, then the interface will not be allowed to continue
# deconfiguration.
#
# The return values for the postup and postdown functions are ignored
# since there's nothing to do if they indicate failure.

#preup() {
#	# This function could be used, for example, to configure a
#	# wireless interface for Cisco LEAP authentication.
#
#	# Test for link on the interface prior to bringing it up.  This
#	# only works on some network adapters and requires the ethtool
#	# package to be installed.

#		ewarn "No link on $1, aborting configuration"
#		return 1
#	fi
#
#	# Remember to return 0 on success
#	return 0
#}

#predown() {

# FORCING MODULES
# The Big Fat Warning :- If you use module forcing do not complain to us or
# file bugs about it not working!
#
# Loading modules is a slow afair - we have to check each one for the following
# 1) Code sanity
# 2) Has the required package been emerged?
# 3) Has it modified anything?
# 4) Have all the dependant modules been loaded?

# Then we have to strip out the conflicting modules based on user preference
# and default configuration and sort them into the correct order.
# Finally we check the end result for dependancies.

# This, of course, takes valuable CPU time so we provide module forcing as a
# means to speed things up. We still do *some* checking but not much.

# It is essential that you force modules in the correct order and supply all
# the modules you need. You must always supply an interface module - we
# supply ifconfig or iproute2.

# The Big Fat Warning :- If you use module forcing do not complain to us or
# file bugs about it not working!

# Now that we've warned you twice, here's how to do it
#modules_force=( "ifconfig" )
#modules_force=( "iproute2" "dhcpcd" )

# We can also apply this to a specific interface
#modules_force_eth1=( "iproute2" )

# The below will not work
#modules_force=( "dhcpcd" )
# No interface (ifconfig/iproute2)
#modules_force=( "ifconfig" "essidnet" "iwconfig" )
# Although it will not crash, essidnet will not work as it has to come after
# iwconfig
#modules_force=( "iproute2" "ifconfig" )
# Although it will not crash, the interface will be setup by ifconfig's rules
# as it comes last in the list - although iproute2 will attempt to setup the
# interface as well.
