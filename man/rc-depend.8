.SH DESCRIPTION
Gentoos init system uses service dependencies to depend on other services.
Rather than just starting in a set order, we start and stop in the order
defined by the services themselves.
For example, most services require local disks to be mounted and as such can
depend on the localmount service. Others depend on and net and dns and will
only start when those dependencies have been satisfied.

One issue of note is that a service can provide another service, which is more
generic. A good example of this is that net.lo and any service linked to it 
provide "net", which a few services depend on. You can of course have a few
network interfaces: modern laptops have 3 being loopback, wired and wireless.
What makes this more interesting is that it could be setup so that both wired
and wireless are optional. So we work out provided services like so :-

1) Always use any services in the runlevel.
.br
2) If no services are defined in the runlevel then use any running services
that satisfy the provide.
.br
3) Append any services in the boot runlevel.

\fBrc-order\fR is primarily used internally by Gentoo and is not meant as an
end-user or admin tool. This man page is purely to describe its function.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB--notrace\fR
Just show the dependencies for the specified services without working out
anything extra.
.TP
\fB-<dependency type>\fR
Work with the specified dependency type, such as ineed, iafter, needsme.
If none are supplied we default to ineed and iuse. If the the runlevel is
starting or stopping we use iafter by default too.
