# /etc/conf.d/rc: Global config file for the Gentoo RC System

# Set to "yes" if you want the rc system to try and start services
# in parallel for a slight speed improvement. When running in parallel we
# prefix the service output with it's name as the output will get
# jumbled up.
RC_PARALLEL="no"

# Set RC_INTERACTIVE to "yes" and you'll be able to press the I key during
# boot so you can choose to start specific services. Set to "no" to disable
# this feature.
RC_INTERACTIVE="yes"

# RC_VERBOSE will make init scripts more verbose and adds
# "Service FOO starting/started/stopping/stopped" messages around each
# init script.
RC_VERBOSE="no"

# RC_QUIET on the other hand will make init scripts quiet and produce no
# output.
RC_QUIET="no"

# Do we allow any started service in the runlevel to satisfy the depedency
# or do we want all of them regardless of state? For example, if net.eth0
# and net.eth0 are in the default runlevel then with RC_STRICT_DEPEND="no"
# both will be started, but services that depend on 'net' will work if either
# one comes up. With RC_STRICT_DEPEND="yes" we would require them both to
# come up.
RC_STRICT_DEPEND="no"

# Do we allow services to be hotplugged? If not, set to RC_HOTPLUG="no"
# NOTE: This does not affect anything hotplug/udev/devd related, just the
# starting/stopping of the init.d service triggered by it.
RC_HOTPLUG="yes"

# Dynamic /dev managers can trigger coldplug events which cause services to
# start before we are ready for them. If this happens, we can defer these
# services to start in the boot runlevel. Set RC_COLDPLUG="no" if you don't
# want this.
# NOTE: This also affects module coldplugging in udev-096 and higher
# If you want module coldplugging but not coldplugging of services then you
# can set RC_COLDPLUG="yes" and RC_PLUG_SERVICES="!*"
RC_COLDPLUG="yes"

# Some people want a finer grain over hotplug/coldplug. RC_PLUG_SERVICES is a
# list of services that are matched in order, either allowing or not. By
# default we allow services through as RC_COLDPLUG/RC_HOTPLUG has to be yes
# anyway.
# Example - RC_PLUG_SERVICES="net.wlan !net.*"
# This allows net.wlan and any service not matching net.* to be plugged.
RC_PLUG_SERVICES=""

# Define network fstypes. Below is the default.
#RC_NET_FS_LIST="afs cifs coda davfs fuse gfs ncpfs nfs nfs4 ocfs2 shfs smbfs"

# RC_FORCE_AUTO tries its best to prevent user interaction during the boot and 
# shutdown process.  For example, fsck will automatically be run or volumes 
# remounted to create proper directory trees.  This feature can be dangerous 
# and is meant ONLY for headless machines where getting a physical console 
# hooked up is a huge pita.
RC_FORCE_AUTO="no"

# SERVICE CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
# These variables are documented here, but should be configured in
# /etc/conf.d/foo for service foo and NOT enabled here unless you
# really want them to work on a global basis.

# Some daemons are started and stopped via start-stop-daemon.
# We can set some things on a per service basis, like the nicelevel.
#export SSD_NICELEVEL="-19"

# Pass ulimit parameters 
#RC_ULIMIT="-u 30"

# It's possible to define extra dependencies for services like so
#RC_NEED="openvpn"
#RC_USE="net.eth0"
