# /etc/conf.d/rc: Global config file for the Gentoo RC System

# Set to "yes" if you want the rc system to try and start services
# in parallel for a slight speed improvement. NOTE: When enabled
# init script output is buffered and displayed in one go when finished.

RC_PARALLEL_STARTUP="no"

# Set RC_INTERACTIVE to "yes" and you'll be able to press the I key during
# boot so you can choose to start specific services. Set to "no" to disable
# this feature.

RC_INTERACTIVE="yes"

# RC_VERBOSE will make init scripts more verbose and adds
# "Service FOO starting/started/stopping/stopped" messages around each
# init script.

RC_VERBOSE="no"

# RC_QUIET on the other hand will make init scripts quiet and produce no
# output.

RC_QUIET="no"

# Do we allow services to be hotplugged? If not, set to RC_HOTPLUG="no"
# NOTE: This does not affect anything hotplug/udev/devd related, just the
# starting/stopping of the init.d service triggered by it.

RC_HOTPLUG="yes"

# Dynamic /dev managers can trigger coldplug events which cause services to
# start before we are ready for them. If this happens, we can defer these
# services to start in the boot runlevel. Set RC_COLDPLUG="no" if you don't
# want this.
# NOTE: This also affects module coldplugging in udev-096 and higher
# If you want module coldplugging but not coldplugging of services then you
# can set RC_COLDPLUG="yes" and RC_PLUG_SERVICES="!*"

RC_COLDPLUG="yes"

# Some people want a finer grain over hotplug/coldplug. RC_PLUG_SERVICES is a
# list of services that are matched in order, either allowing or not. By
# default we allow services through as RC_COLDPLUG/RC_HOTPLUG has to be yes
# anyway.
# Example - RC_PLUG_SERVICES="net.wlan !net.*"
# This allows net.wlan and any service not matching net.* to be plugged.

RC_PLUG_SERVICES=""

# RC_USE_CONFIG_PROFILE allows you to have different /etc/conf.d files 
# based on your runlevel - if a conf.d file for your profile does not exist
# then we try and use the default one.
# To enable runlevel selection at boot, append "softlevel=foobar" to your
# kernel line to change to the foobar runlevel.  Here we would search for
# /etc/conf.d/<service>.foobar config files before trying to use the default
# /etc/conf.d/<service>.

RC_USE_CONFIG_PROFILE="yes"

# RC_FORCE_AUTO tries its best to prevent user interaction during the boot and 
# shutdown process.  For example, fsck will automatically be run or volumes 
# remounted to create proper directory trees.  This feature can be dangerous 
# and is meant ONLY for headless machines where getting a physical console 
# hooked up is a huge pita.

RC_FORCE_AUTO="no"

# LINUX SPECIFIC OPTIONS

# This is the number of tty's used in most of the rc-scripts (like
# consolefont, numlock, etc ...)

RC_TTY_NUMBER=11

# RC_DOWN_INTERFACE allows you to specify if RC will bring the interface
# completely down when it stops. The default is yes, but there are some
# instances where you may not want this to happen such as using Wake On LAN.

RC_DOWN_INTERFACE="yes"

# RC_DOWN_HARDDISK allows you to specify if RC will put harddisks to
# standby mode when it stops.

RC_DOWN_HARDDISK="yes"

# RC_VOLUME_ORDER allows you to specify, or even remove the volume setup
# for various volume managers (MD, EVMS2, LVM, DM, etc).  Note that they are
# stopped in reverse order.

RC_VOLUME_ORDER="raid evms lvm dm"

# RC_BOOTLOG will generate a log of the boot messages shown on the console.  
# Useful for headless machines or debugging.  You need to emerge the 
# app-admin/showconsole package for this to work.  Note that this probably
# won't work correctly with boot splash.

RC_BOOTLOG="no"

# Set to "yes" if you want to benchmark system boot with bootchart.
# You'll need to emerge the app-benchmarks/bootchart package for this to work.

RC_BOOTCHART="no"

# RC_USE_FSTAB allows you to override the default mount options for the 
# standard /proc, /sys, /dev, and /dev/pts mount points.  Note that this 
# is the new way for selecting ramfs/tmpfs/etc... for udev mounting.

RC_USE_FSTAB="no"

# Use this variable to control the /dev management behavior.
#  auto   - let the scripts figure out what's best at boot
#  devfs  - use devfs (requires sys-fs/devfsd)
#  udev   - use udev (requires sys-fs/udev)
#  static - let the user manage /dev (YOU need to create ALL device nodes)

RC_DEVICES="auto"

# UDEV OPTION:
# Set to "yes" if you want to save /dev to a tarball on shutdown
# and restore it on startup.  This is useful if you have a lot of
# custom device nodes that udev does not handle/know about.

RC_DEVICE_TARBALL="no"

# RC_DMESG_LEVEL sets the level at which logging of messages is done to the
# console.  See dmesg(8) for more info.

RC_DMESG_LEVEL="1"
