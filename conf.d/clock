# /etc/conf.d/clock

# Set CLOCK to "UTC" if your system clock is set to UTC (also known as
# Greenwich Mean Time).  If your clock is set to the local time, then 
# set CLOCK to "local".  Note that if you dual boot with Windows, then 
# you should set it to "local".

CLOCK="UTC"

# Select the proper timezone.  For valid values, peek inside of the
# /usr/share/zoneinfo/ directory.  For example, some common values are
# "America/New_York" or "EST5EDT" or "Europe/Berlin".

#TIMEZONE="Factory"

# If you wish to pass any other arguments to hwclock during bootup, 
# you may do so here.

CLOCK_OPTS=""

# If you want to set the Hardware Clock to the current System Time 
# during shutdown, then say "yes" here.

CLOCK_SYSTOHC="no"

# Newer FHS specs say this file should live in /var/lib rather than
# /etc.  If you care about such things, feel free to change this value.
# Note that a blank value means that you do not wish to even use the
# adjtime facility.  This is the default behavior as adjtime can be
# very fragile.  If the clock is updated without updating the adjtime
# file (which is common when using services such as ntp), then the
# clock can be screwed up when it gets updated at next boot.

#CLOCK_ADJTIME="/var/lib/adjtime"
#CLOCK_ADJTIME="/etc/adjtime"
CLOCK_ADJTIME=""
