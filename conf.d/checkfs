# FSCK_SHUTDOWN causes checkfs to trigger during shutdown as well as startup.
# The end result of this is that if any periodic non-root filesystem checks are
# scheduled, under normal circumstances the actual check will happen during
# shutdown rather than at next boot.
# This is useful when periodic filesystem checks are causing undesirable
# delays at startup, but such delays at shutdown are acceptable.
